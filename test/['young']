THE RAILEY CASE;

<P>
THE BRUTAL ATTACK ON THE POPULAR PASTOR'S WIFE AND HIS SUICIDE ATTEMPT BECAME 
DALLAS' MOST HAUNTING AND SENSATIONAL MYSTERY IN A DECADE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bewildered friends and followers would recall that he looked tired and 
depressed, still grief-stricken and mystified over the savage assault on his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
Little more than a week had passed since he found her comatose on the garage 
floor, choked senseless and left for dead. She had not regained consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in the early evening hours of April 30, 1987, the intense, balding man 
excused himself and disappeared into a private hospital suite. 
</P>
<P>
He locked and chained the door, sat down with pen and paper and began composing 
a chilling letter. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a demon inside my soul," he wrote. "It has always been there. My 
demon tries to lead me down paths I do not want to follow. At times that demon 
has lured me into doing things I do not want to do. 
</P>
<P>
". . . My demon has finally gotten the upper hand." 
</P>
<P>
When security officers broke in the next morning, they found him sprawled 
across the bed. He was alive but unconscious and in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby were empty bottles of prescription drugs and his rambling letter, which 
began with instructions for his funeral and ended thusly: 
</P>
<P>
"I have finally made the decision to take care of myself. I have grown weak. 
God has remained strong. Therein lies your hope. I have none. 
</P>
<P>
"Walker L. Railey." 
</P>
<P>
The vicious attack on Walker Railey's wife and his ensuing suicide attempt 
devastated three families, split a church and outraged a city. 
</P>
<P>
For Peggy Railey was by no means an ordinary homemaker, and her husband was 
perhaps Dallas' most dynamic and socially conscious young minister. At 39, 
Walker Railey reigned as the senior pastor of the city's 6,000-member First 
United Methodist Church and loomed as a rising star in his mainstream 
Protestant denomination. 
</P>
<P>
The news of the suicide attempt swept through town, nowhere more devastatingly 
than at First Methodist, where Railey's flock was already reeling from the 
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Keep Him in Our Prayers' 
</P>
<P>
His chief assistant, the Rev. Gordon Casad, told the congregation the next 
Sunday, "We must remember our pastor and the troubling of his mind and spirit 
and keep him in our prayers." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Railey was now a suspect, Park Stearns, supervisor in the Dallas FBI 
office, replied: "This is a big no comment." 
</P>
<P>
Although police refused to reveal the contents of Railey's letter, they 
described it as an apparent suicide note. And they redoubled their efforts to 
review with the convalescing minister what happened the night his wife was 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
A fellow pastor, the Rev. David Shawyer of Plymouth Park Methodist Church, 
said, "I'm praying that it is not what it looks like. I'm praying that what the 
police are suggesting could never be true. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm praying this will all come out some other way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latest Twist in Mystery 
</P>
<P>
Railey's attempt on his own life was only the latest twist in what would be 
called Dallas' most haunting and sensational mystery in a decade. One 
unrestrained commentator called the attempted murder the city's most 
extraordinary crime since the assassination of President Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Railey survived, but only barely so. Comatose, she could not identify her 
assailant. 
</P>
<P>
Several anonymous, typewritten death threats preceded the attack, apparently 
provoked by Railey's strong sermons and public statements against racial 
prejudice and injustice. But friends said Peggy Railey did not frighten easily, 
and she had encouraged her husband not to soften his stand. 
</P>
<P>
The last letter was slipped under the door of a church office just prior to 
Easter Sunday services. It said: "EASTER IS WHEN CHRIST AROSE, BUT YOU ARE 
GOING DOWN." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wore Bulletproof Vest 
</P>
<P>
Under the stern scrutiny of security officers, Railey delivered his Easter 
sermon wearing a bulletproof vest beneath his robes. 
</P>
<P>
It would be his last appearance in the pulpit of First Methodist's historic old 
sanctuary. He hammered the congregation with a theme of death and resurrection 
that morning. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to die," he said, pointing his finger at parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to die," he repeated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to die." 
</P>
<P>
Police and church officials first theorized that the attempt on Peggy Railey's 
life was some kind of grotesque retaliation for her husband's outspokenness. 
</P>
<P>
With his wife in critical condition, Railey stationed himself outside her 
hospital room, interrupting his vigil only for a trip downtown to give 
investigators an account of his activities the night of April 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noticed Open Garage Door 
</P>
<P>
He said he'd spent the evening doing research at Southern Methodist University 
libraries. Returning home about 12:40 a.m., he said, he noticed that a door to 
the darkened two-car garage was partly open. 
</P>
<P>
Driving inside with his headlights on, he found his wife lying on the floor, 
writhing in convulsions. Her face was puffy and discolored and she was frothing 
at the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
He said the children, Ryan, 5, and Megan, 2, were inside the house and 
unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
After the interview, Capt. John Holt, 37, the tall, sandy-haired supervisor of 
crimes against persons, told reporters the questioning was routine. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any indicators that would point to him as a suspect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arranged for Hospital Suite 
</P>
<P>
Railey returned to the hospital to arrange for a suite near his wife. He spent 
the day greeting a parade of visitors who expressed shock, sorrow and support. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who came to share their grief that day was a striking frosted 
blonde who carried a single red rose and disappeared into Railey's hospital 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
With the investigation in full swing and the FBI trying to identify the source 
of the death threats, Railey continued his hospital vigil under heavy police 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just numb. . . . He's overwhelmed by it," said Ralph Shannon, a longtime 
church member. 
</P>
<P>
If Railey was silent, his ministerial colleagues were not. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Joseph Ofseyer of Congregation Shearith Israel said that Railey had 
suffered for his message of justice and equality but that the religious 
community would not "be cowed into silence" and "permit such a person to stand 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
Almost lost or overlooked in the outcry was an observation by Police Lt. Ron 
Waldrop that the abusive letters appeared to be the work of one individual and 
not the concerted effort of a white supremacist group. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no central theme," he added. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, the FBI determined that the death threats had been written 
on an office typewriter at First Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
Walker Railey's rise to clerical prominence seemed almost preordained from his 
turbulent childhood days in Owensboro, Ky., a coal mining town on the south 
bank of the Ohio River. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest of three children, Railey grew up a nonsmoker and nondrinker who 
delivered his first sermon at age 17 and became something of a circuit preacher 
while a history major at Western Kentucky University. 
</P>
<P>
He attended Vanderbilt Divinity School for a year, then headed to Dallas and 
the Perkins Theological Seminary at Southern Methodist University. 
</P>
<P>
It was there, in 1970, that he met Margaret Nicolai, an equally talented, 
intelligent and religiously dedicated young musician whom everyone called 
Peggy. She had arrived at SMU from Wisconsin to pursue a master's degree in 
organ music. 
</P>
<P>
Acquaintances say Peggy recognized early on that young Walker was a man with 
great ambition and potential but that she was not much taken with him 
romantically. His persistence won her over and the couple were married in 
August, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
After obtaining a doctor of ministry in 1973, Railey ministered to several 
rural churches in Oklahoma and then was appointed an associate pastor at First 
Methodist in Dallas. In 1980, after a stint as a senior minister at a suburban 
Dallas church, he returned to First Methodist as senior pastor at age 33. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eight Ministers Became Bishops 
</P>
<P>
The appointment was the most dramatic step in a meteoric rise. Although not 
even the largest Methodist church in Dallas, First Methodist had the reputation 
as the nation's mother church of Methodism, in no small part because eight of 
its ministers had gone on to become bishops. 
</P>
<P>
Under Railey's leadership, First Methodist grew and prospered, its membership 
approaching 6,000 and its annual budget doubling to $2 million. And although 
Railey himself was short, balding and physically unimposing, his radiant 
ministry served as a magnet for the young, energetic and socially conscious 
while not alienating older, more conservative parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke out boldly against those who practiced or condoned racial intolerance. 
He clashed with a City Council member over what he perceived to be a racist 
stance on illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
He challenged President Reagan to take a "more visible and articulate stand" 
for peace and he once said of fundamentalist Jerry Falwell, "I guarantee he 
doesn't speak for the Kingdom of God, let alone the people in it." 
</P>
<P>
When the threats came, the Raileys seemed to take them in stride. The FBI 
encouraged Peggy Railey and the children to leave town for a while. Although 
she went to her parents' home for four days, she did not seem overly concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Yarrington, wife of First Methodist's minister of music and one of Peggy 
Railey's closest friends, said Peggy told her that she and Walker were taking 
precautions but that they refused to be intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
Long before the attack, the Yarringtons and Raileys pledged to care for one 
another's children in the event of tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
That pledge would soon come due. 
</P>
<P>
As Railey and his wife lay near death in the same intensive care unit, police 
were anxious to talk again with First Methodist's senior pastor. After his 
first interview, police found unspecified "inconsistencies" in Railey's account 
of April 21. 
</P>
<P>
Friends in the church hired a tough, no-nonsense criminal defense attorney 
named Doug Mulder to advise Railey, and as the minister recovered, he wasn't 
talking to police. 
</P>
<P>
He did, however, speak with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest with you . . . I just don't know anything," he told a veteran 
religion reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he told the Associated Press: 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't attack my wife. I didn't plan to have someone attack my wife. I 
didn't orchestrate a plan to attack my wife. And if I had written the letters, 
I wouldn't have written them on a typewriter in the church. But I didn't write 
them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Don't Understand Why' 
</P>
<P>
He could not rationalize his suicide attempt, which he knew was construed by 
some as an admission of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why I did it, any more than I understand why I lived beyond 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Mulder arranged for a private polygraph test, which indicated that Railey did 
not try to kill his wife. Presumably because of those results, Mulder approved 
a police-administered examination the next day. That exercise was described as 
"inconclusive." 
</P>
<P>
"The results showed that he didn't have anything to do with the attack, nor did 
he conspire with anyone," Mulder said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Railey's followers took new heart, investigators were unimpressed and 
restated the ongoing request to interview him. 
</P>
<P>
Holt accused Mulder of misrepresenting the outcome of the police-administered 
examination. He suggested that some of Railey's responses were "untruthful," 
but refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
All but overlooked in the flap over the polygraphs was an unattributed police 
statement that Railey's account of his activities the night of April 21 was "in 
direct conflict with indisputable evidence." 
</P>
<P>
The key word was "indisputable." 
</P>
<P>
The frosted blonde with the sparkling eyes was no stranger to the congregation 
at First United Methodist Church. Lucy Papillon grew up in the magnificent 
sanctuary, the daughter of the Rev. Robert E. Goodrich Jr., a former senior 
pastor and later a Methodist bishop. 
</P>
<P>
A portrait of Goodrich, who died in 1985, hangs in the First Methodist foyer. 
</P>
<P>
"She had that knotted Goodrich chin, his thin, drawn smile, and the dark eyes 
that were his most distinctive feature -- eyes that seemed remote but also 
searching and intelligent," journalist Larry Wright, a childhood acquaintance, 
wrote in Texas Monthly. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a strong face, like her father's, and if in some lights it appeared 
hard, in others you could detect a vulnerable and even wounded soul who had 
lived past the point where life surprised her." 
</P>
<P>
As a youngster, Lucy played the piano in Sunday school and was a cheerleader at 
an exclusive girls' school. She entered Southern Methodist University in 1959 
to pursue a degree in music education and, four years later, married a 
Methodist preacher. They were divorced in 1973 after she bore two sons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worked Variety of Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Friends say she worked at a variety of jobs, including a stint as a part-time 
model. Somewhere along the way she became enamored with psychology. She married 
and divorced again and, in 1982, received a doctorate in psychology and moved 
to California to complete her training. She found various jobs in her new field 
there and reportedly began to visit the Esalen commune. 
</P>
<P>
And it was there that Lucy decided to take on her identity as "Papillon," 
French for butterfly. In 1986 she opened a private psychology practice in 
Dallas and legally changed her name to Lucy Papillon. 
</P>
<P>
On July 14, 1987, Dallas County's chief prosecutor sat down with police and the 
FBI and heard for the first time all the facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenged to 'Talk or Walk' 
</P>
<P>
His face flushed with anger, his thick mustache almost bristling, Norm Kinne, 
53, stormed from the meeting room into a cluster of reporters and challenged 
Walker Railey, as one headline proclaimed, to "talk or walk." 
</P>
<P>
Eyes flashing and his finger jabbing at the nearest of four television cameras, 
Kinne declared: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of this man fooling with the justice system and the life of his 
wife. . . . I'm going to tell you, Walker Railey, I'm tired of you messing with 
the Dallas Police Department, and you're going to come before the Dallas County 
grand jury and you're going to clear up these discrepancies, or you're going to 
leave the country!" 
</P>
<P>
Kinne could subpoena Railey to appear before grand jurors, but he had no way to 
compel him to answer questions if he invoked the constitutional protection 
against self-incrimination. Nor was it in the fiery prosecutor's domain to 
order a reticent Railey out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photographs Triggered Outburst 
</P>
<P>
But at that moment, nobody was foolhardy enough to argue the issue with Kinne. 
</P>
<P>
Later that evening, a vaguely contrite Kinne said it was the photographs of 
Peggy Railey after the attack that so outraged him and triggered the outburst. 
</P>
<P>
"I got irritated because we have a lady here who is a loving wife and mother 
and who is lying in a hospital more dead than alive," he said. "And we have an 
alleged pillar of the community who will not talk to us about this." 
</P>
<P>
Six days before Kinne's outburst, a Dallas Morning News story linked Lucy 
Papillon to the Railey case, calling her a potential "reluctant witness." 
</P>
<P>
The article said mobile telephone records revealed that Railey called Papillon 
twice the night of the attack. Railey had neglected to mention those calls in 
his lengthy interview with police the morning after April 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Calls Placed to Home 
</P>
<P>
Phone records also showed that Railey placed two calls to his own home between 
midnight and 12:30 a.m., the last one about 10 minutes before he reported 
finding his wife near death on the garage floor. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators refused to discuss the significance of the mobile phone records 
but it seemed safe to assume they somehow represented the "indisputable 
evidence" of inconsistencies in Railey's story. 
</P>
<P>
Later, on the eve of a grand jury meeting on the Railey case, the Morning News 
reported that Railey had visited Papillon the night his wife was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the jury room, Kinne was eager to confront Railey, although he was 
certain that the embattled minister would refuse to answer questions and invoke 
his Fifth Amendment rights. Railey took the Fifth -- 43 times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knew Nothing About Attack 
</P>
<P>
"I have followed the advice of my lawyer consistently and will consistently do 
that," Railey remarked brusquely when he emerged from the closed-door session. 
</P>
<P>
Papillon spent an hour before the panel and, according to her attorney, Phil 
Burleson, answered every question. She knew nothing about the attack, Burleson 
said, and then cautioned reporters against drawing conclusions that his client 
was romantically linked with Railey. 
</P>
<P>
But it made no difference. Leaks poured out of the grand jury room that Lucy 
Papillon was Walker Railey's mistress. 
</P>
<P>
According to those present, Papillon told grand jurors she first met Railey on 
a religious television show and they became romantically involved in June, 
1986, about the same time she changed her name. She said she had accompanied 
Railey on several ministerial trips and had vacationed with him in California. 
</P>
<P>
Nor were their liaisons confined to this country. Papillon revealed that Railey 
stopped over for a prearranged rendezvous in London while returning from a 
World Methodist Council meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, in July, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In one particularly chilling disclosure, Lucy said they embraced and kissed in 
Walker's hospital suite while Peggy lay near death nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sensational revelations, the grand jury testimony raised almost as 
many questions as it answered. And the "indisputable evidence" remained cloaked 
in secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have a lot of discrepancies, but we're not going to discuss them," 
said Police Lt. Waldrop. "There is no statue of limitations on attempted 
murder, and that's how long we'll be working on it." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the discrepancies and the indisputable evidence did unfold. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of the attack, Railey made several calls from a cellular telephone 
installed in his car at church expense only hours earlier as a security measure 
because of anonymous threats. A phone company computer recorded the times. 
</P>
<P>
Railey called home at 5:55 p.m. to say he was leaving the office. At 5:58 p.m., 
he telephoned Papillon and talked for one minute. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving home shortly before 6:30 p.m., Railey said he found his wife working 
on a faulty garage door lock with a bar of soap. Investigators later found no 
trace of soap on the lock, which was working fine. 
</P>
<P>
Railey said he sat on the hood of his wife's Chrysler and talked with her for 
several minutes. He told her he intended to spend the evening on a research 
project at the SMU libraries. He did not change from his business suit and left 
the house a little after 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
At 6:38 p.m., Railey, who never wore a watch, called on the car phone for the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
He said he spent half an hour or so at SMU's Bridwell Library and was back in 
his car by 7:26 p.m., at which time he phoned the family baby-sitter and 
discussed plans for a trip to San Antonio the Raileys planned later in the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:32 p.m., he phoned Papillon at her home near SMU. He drove directly to her 
house, where he spent the next 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Railey Went Back to Library 
</P>
<P>
Railey told a friend later he went there to get some relaxation tapes to help 
relieve stress. 
</P>
<P>
From 8 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., Railey was back at Bridwell, where he asked a 
librarian what time the library closed. At 8:30, Railey, using a pay phone, 
called home on a private line. Peggy Railey told him she was putting the 
children to bed. She then called her parents long distance in Tyler and talked 
from 8:49 p.m. until 9:14 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At 8:53 p.m., Raily bought gas at a Texaco station near campus. After drinking 
a wine cooler, he said, he returned to Fondren Library, SMU's main library. But 
no one saw him there until after 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:30 p.m., a jogger in the Raileys' neighborhood spotted a man in a business 
suit and street shoes running through a yard south of the Railey home. Between 
10:15 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., a neighbor heard rustling sounds in the alley behind 
the home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tried to Leave Business Card 
</P>
<P>
Sometime after 11 p.m., a librarian saw Railey at Fondren. Upon leaving at 
midnight, he attempted to give his business card to a student at the checkout 
desk. On the back of the card was a message requesting help in finding research 
information. Railey also noted the time, 10:30 p.m., when in fact it was 
midnight, the student told police. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:03 a.m., Railey called home on the car phone, but this time he used the 
public line. According to friends, the family seldom answered the public line, 
which was connected to an answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Babe," he said. "I'm calling you from my mobile phone. Peg, it's about, 
oh, I don't know. I don't have a watch. It's somewhere between 10:30 and 10:45, 
somewhere along in there. I worked at Bridwell until they closed and now I'm 
going to Fondren." 
</P>
<P>
This could not have been true. He had in fact just left Fondren, according to 
other accounts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lock the Garage Door' 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be in about 1. If you want to, go ahead and lock the garage door and I'll 
park out front. It really doesn't matter to me at this point. My concern is 
that you're safe. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
This portion of the tape might explain why Peggy Railey would enter the garage 
that night. Even so, Railey would still have to explain why, if he really 
intended to speak with his wife, he had called on the public line and left a 
message. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three minutes later, Railey phoned the answering machine again, and on 
this occasion gave the correct time: 12:29. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Babe," he began. "It's 12:29 and I'm on the way home from SMU. . . . 
Everything really went well. I got a lot accomplished. I had to leave my card 
with the reference librarian because there was one deal that I couldn't quite 
work out. I'm not calling on the private line because I know you're already 
asleep, but in case you get up with the kids, I just wanted you to know that 
I'm on my way home. It's 12:30. I'll be home about 12:45. 
</P>
<P>
"Love you. Bye-bye." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Sign of a Struggle 
</P>
<P>
At just past 12:40, Railey drove into his driveway and found his wife. 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of a struggle. There was no skin under her fingernails to 
indicate that she had either fought her assailant or scratched herself when 
grasping at whatever was pulled around her throat. 
</P>
<P>
Railey said he determined that the children were safe and notified police. 
</P>
<P>
"Dallas Emergency, Ms. . . ," the dispatcher answered. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Walker Railey," he interrupted. "Send the paramedics and police, 
please." 
</P>
<P>
An ambulance arrived, along with neighbors. Inside the house, both children 
were in the living room, Megan watching a silent television screen and Ryan 
staring blankly ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Months later, Kinne told a reporter he thought it possible that Ryan witnessed 
the attack, but he said the youngster gave investigators inconsistent accounts 
of what might have happened that night. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Daddy did it," the boy told investigators once. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors transferred Peggy Railey, her body alive but her brain barely 
functioning, from a Dallas hospital to a nursing home in east Texas so she 
could be near her parents.

Bill and Billie Jo Nicolai live in Tyler, but they had spent almost all day 
every day in Dallas, about 60 miles away, attending to Peggy's needs. Though a 
full-service hospital was no longer required, she remained in a vegetative 
state from which she might never awaken. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Dallas, no sign was posted, but the Raileys' home was quietly put on 
the market and sold. 
</P>
<P>
Walker Railey voluntarily surrendered his credentials as a minister in the 
United Methodist Church, and then surrendered control of his wife's legal 
affairs to her parents. He granted temporary custody of his children to the 
friends who had kept them since April 22, John and Diane Yarrington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother Assumed Guardianship 
</P>
<P>
Billie Jo Nicolai requested that a court grant her guardianship of her 
daughter, and Railey waived his right to continue in that traditionally spousal 
role. 
</P>
<P>
And then, after the stunning developments and disclosures of mid-November, 
Railey vanished. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he has some job prospects," Yarrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few months, Railey and Dallas reporters played a game of 
hide-and-seek. 
</P>
<P>
In early December, Railey told religion reporter Helen Parmley of the Dallas 
Morning News in a telephone interview from California that he fled despair, not 
speculation. And he maintained that he was not abandoning his children. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, while I am relocating, looking for work, financially strapped, 
not knowing where I'm going to end up or what I'm going to be doing, everybody 
involved in this drama believes . . . the most stable, loving, Christian 
environment they can be in is where they are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But before anybody could get themselves too lathered up over Railey's plight, 
Dallas Times Herald columnist Laura Miller put a new slant on the case by 
telling a tale of the anger and indignation of Peggy Railey's family -- her 
father and her grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Both believe Railey was behind the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The motive? "A divorced man doesn't get to be bishop," said the grandmother, 
Ella Renfro. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Wright, a contributing editor at Texas Monthly magazine, grew up in the 
First United Methodist Church in Dallas. His childhood pastor was Robert 
Goodrich Jr., Lucy Papillon's father. 
</P>
<P>
He left the church once in disenchantment but had been drawn back by Railey's 
socially contemporary ministry. Then he had seen the devastation at First 
Methodist after the attack on Peggy, Walker's suicide attempt and the 
minister's affair with Lucy. 
</P>
<P>
So Wright was less a journalist than a confused and angry member of the 
congregation when he confronted Railey. 
</P>
<P>
Did Peggy know about his affair with Lucy? 
</P>
<P>
"We -- that never came up," Railey stammered. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't know? 
</P>
<P>
"I can only say it never emerged." 
</P>
<P>
Did she suspect? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no way of knowing, regarding that, that she suspected at all, about 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Changing the subject, Railey revealed he had slipped into the First Methodist 
sanctuary to attend funeral services for a family friend. Some of his former 
parishioners avoided him but most embraced him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Could Feel Pain' 
</P>
<P>
"They could feel my pain," Railey said, crying. He said he also felt love. 
</P>
<P>
Did you feel a sense of shame, Wright asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a great need to be forgiven, if that's what you're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Wright decided that was as much of a concession as he was likely to get. But 
before departing, he said he could not construct an innocent man out of 
Railey's behavior. The journalist recounted Railey's misleading testimony to 
the police, his avoidance of the grand jury and his inexplicable actions on the 
night of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Think You Are Guilty' 
</P>
<P>
"I think you are a guilty person," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear what you're saying," Railey replied. 
</P>
<P>
Wright did not know what to think. Railey failed to absorb his blunt 
accusation, choosing instead to analyze it with detachment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm aware that nobody can sit down with all the facts that are supposedly 
known . . . and just make it all fit. That's a frustration that everyone has 
felt, including me," Railey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Confess," Wright urged him. "It will haunt you forever, it will drive you 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if that's a word of advice, a backhand comfort or what," Railey 
said. "I'm not guilty. I didn't do it. I don't feel tormented by the guilt of 
what I didn't do." 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 2, Billie Jo Nicolai filed a legal bombshell in civil court, accusing 
Railey of "maliciously" attempting to kill his wife and orchestrating a "clumsy 
attempt" to cover his actions with a phony alibi. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit sought damages for "physical and mental pain, disfigurement, 
anguish and physical impairment" on behalf of Mrs. Nicolai's comatose daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Concern over the cost of Peggy Railey's medical expenses was the overriding 
reason for the action, but the family's decision was also emotional, said 
Billie Jo Nicolai's attorney, Bill Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Are Bitter' 
</P>
<P>
"They are bitter," he said. "They are angry." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Nicolai, Peggy's younger brother, revealed that Railey had visited his wife 
no more than three times and that after a Christmas visit with his two 
children, Ryan had suffered severe emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
Kinne, Dallas' chief prosecutor, had sent an investigator to question Ryan 
about the night of April 21, and the youngster talked freely about almost 
everything. But whenever the investigator asked about the attack, Ryan would 
tune her out. He would turn his back and try to leave the room. 
</P>
<P>
Railey moved to California, to a Victorian flat not far from San Francisco Bay. 
The rent reportedly was $1,600, and both he and Papillon signed the lease. 
</P>
<P>
Initial attempts to serve Railey with legal notice of the Nicolai civil suit 
were unsuccessful. Eventually, he was spotted at a hotel, and papers were 
slapped under the windshield wiper of a car driven by Papillon, with Railey 
apparently slumped down inside. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely one year after the events of April, 1987, a state district judge 
ruled that Walker Railey "intentionally, knowingly, maliciously and brutally 
attempted to strangle his wife" and cover up his actions with a "false alibi." 
</P>
<P>
Judge John Whittington issued a preliminary civil judgment on April 22, 1988, 
holding Railey financially liable for the injuries to his wife. The extent of 
damages would be determined later by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, although significant, had no bearing on the criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Whittington's action came after Railey failed to respond to legal notices of 
the suit. The judge said Railey, by his technical default, had admitted all the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fled Bay Area 
</P>
<P>
Railey could no longer be found. Under siege from the media, he broke the lease 
on the San Francisco "love nest" he shared with Papillon on her visits from 
Dallas. It appeared he had fled the Bay Area altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"The court can issue a subpoena that compels him to come answer my questions," 
Arnold said. "But today, I have less of an idea where he is than at any time 
since this case started." 
</P>
<P>
In June, doctors reported a slight improvement in Peggy Railey's condition and 
she was returned to Dallas and placed in the Baylor Institute for 
Rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William Parker, the institute's medical director, said she could turn her 
head and hear, but could not process what she heard. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can establish anything that seems to stimulate a response that could be 
interpreted as functional, then we would continue to try, through repetition, 
to improve on that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condition Downgraded 
</P>
<P>
Parker said he didn't think his team of specialists would be able to determine 
whether Peggy Railey would ever communicate again. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the odds are probably going to be against it, but time is the only 
thing that's going to tell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After more than a year in a vegetative state, doctors downgraded her condition 
to a "persistent vegetative state," meaning, as a neurosurgeon explained, that 
her chances for recovery were "nil." 
</P>
<P>
After two months in Dallas, she was quietly returned to the nursing home in 
Tyler where her parents resumed their tender, but apparently hopeless, daily 
care. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Kinne sat puffing his pipe in the district attorney's office and 
reflecting on the Railey case, his opinions no less candid than when he first 
viewed the terrible pictures of Peggy Railey's wounds. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy's a liar," Kinne said. "He's trying to cover his tracks. He wasn't 
where he was at the time he says he was. Now the question is, if he wasn't 
there, where was he? 
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion that everybody's drawn is that he was home choking out his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
"But that doesn't necessarily follow. There's no proof he was at the scene at 
the time she was strangled. There's no evidence that he strangled her or that 
he knew who strangled her or that he arranged or participated in any way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Concrete Evidence 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say Kinne didn't think about prosecuting Walker Railey. He 
visualized presenting all the evidence that showed Railey lied, that he 
contrived an alibi and that he told no one of visiting his girlfriend that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
But with a defense move for an instructed verdict of innocent, the judge might 
ask, "Where is the evidence that he choked his wife?" Kinne said. 
</P>
<P>
The trial would probably be over before it began. 
</P>
<P>
As 1988 drew to an end, Kinne had not surrendered hope that the case might 
someday be solved, but any possibility was a long shot. Peggy Railey might 
miraculously recover and identify her assailant, or even young Ryan Railey 
might have seen something and be able to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing Incriminating 
</P>
<P>
Lucy Papillon might eventually shed light on the case, but Kinne once pointed 
out that she had said nothing incriminating "since we don't have adultery laws 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
For Kinne, Walker Railey remained the ultimate enigma. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing you'd expect from a guy like him would be to give up his wife 
and kids and flit off to California. Just say to hell with it and take off. 
It's just not what you'd expect from a man of his stature. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives every indication of guilt, whether he is guilty or not." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Railey Didn't Show 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 5, Judge Whittington heard testimony in a one-day trial to determine if 
Walker Railey should pay damages to the Nicolai family. Railey didn't show up. 
</P>
<P>
The family was awarded $16 million -- half to cover Peggy's care, half to 
punish Railey. It was a ruling more of symbolism than substance, a hollow 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said he didn't know where Railey was, or how much money he had. He 
doubted that his wife's family would ever collect the $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
On videotape, the court watched therapists treating Peggy Railey, who has 
virtually no body control and a haunting, lifeless look in her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, her sister-in-law, Linda Nicolai, told of an experience at the hospital 
one day that suggested the depth of Peggy Railey's anguish. 
</P>
<P>
As Peggy's wheelchair went down the hall, she passed a man exercising with a 
cord similar to what police believe was used to choke Peggy. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Railey began sweating, hyperventilating and rubbing her arms together. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Nicolai added: 
</P>
<P>
"She kept looking at me . . . with this wild look on her face and trying to 
tell me something."

ONE ENCHANTED DAY WHEN PETER RABBIT STIRRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB O'SULLIVAN, O'Sullivan is a travel writer based in Canoga Park. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The names Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail have never figured very large in my 
adult vocabulary. Not that they weren't there. They were just too deep in 
memory for easy retrieval. 
</P>
<P>
Your average semi-macho guys, or even us everyday garden variety couch 
potatoes, just don't tend to hang onto those memories we formed before being 
checked out on two-wheel bikes. Unless we've had a refresher course. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I recently had a refresher course. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, we were in the Lake District of Cumbria -- which is about hip 
high on the British Isles -- and having a pretty good time. There aren't a 
whole lot of places on this earth as pretty or as peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Lakes 
</P>
<P>
We were told there are 23 lakes. Someone else said there are 19, so I suspect 
the total number sort of depends on whether or not it rained recently. I do 
know that however many there are, they're in one of the most awe-inspiring 
settings. 
</P>
<P>
Mile after mile of rolling meadows, forests and mountains, their tops 
frequently lost in cloud. There are fields of wildflowers, waterfalls and about 
every green that nature's got. 
</P>
<P>
There are sheep -- armies of sheep, eating as fast as they can but never 
catching up with the growing landscape. And there's something else . . . a 
feeling that goes with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce and I were talking with Paul Carlin, a friend who'd come to the Lake 
District from London to manage the Borrowdale Gates Hotel near Keswick. He 
grinned as we raved about the countryside, as proud as if he'd created it 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visitors From All Over 
</P>
<P>
"It's truly unique, you know, and I know what you mean about the feeling," 
Carlin said. "People come to the Lake District from your Wisconsin and 
Minnesota, where lakes are common. 
</P>
<P>
"Even from Colorado and British Columbia, whose mountains and lakes dwarf what 
we have here. And they're just as enchanted as everyone else. And I think I 
know the reason. It's not the lakes, you know." 
</P>
<P>
"What is it?" Joyce asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Carlin said, "I'm almost afraid to talk about it." He leaned forward 
and lowered his voice. "It may be something left over from the Druids or 
Merlin's time, but I think it's magic. I really believe there is a kind of 
enchantment here." 
</P>
<P>
We'd almost come to that conclusion on our own. You can't drive through the 
area without having that thought. We'd recently visited Dove Cottage, where 
William Wordsworth lived with his family. 
</P>
<P>
Though the cottage looks as if it's 300 years old, it's really kind of 
commonplace. The most unusual thing about it is that the children's rooms are 
wallpapered with newspapers. (The guidebook said Wordsworth thought it would 
make the rooms warmer in the winter.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Setting Is Unusual 
</P>
<P>
But it's not the cottage, it's the setting that makes it unusual. When you see 
the view from the room where Wordsworth did his writing, you begin to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
You see Lake Grasmere cupped in rolling green hills, as still and reflecting as 
a mirror. The morning we were there, a few clouds were all but settling on its 
surface; you could feel a bit of the magic. 
</P>
<P>
There was no way a man of Wordsworth's talents could have lived in the area 
without becoming what he was -- a poet laureate, the greatest poet on nature 
that England has produced. 
</P>
<P>
"Wordsworth? Yes," Carlin said. " 'Lucy,' 'The Solitary Reaper' and 'Daffodils' 
are very nice. And you'll never convince me that James Hilton didn't spend some 
time here before he wrote about Shangri-La in 'Lost Horizon,' but I was 
thinking more in terms of Peter, Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail." 
</P>
<P>
"Who?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter Rabbit!" Joyce exclaimed. "That's right! Beatrix Potter lived here in 
the Lake Country, didn't she?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Almost Missed House 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I meant by enchantment," Carlin said. "Her house is just down the 
way. I'll jot down some directions for you." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't "just down the way" at all. It was a couple of lakes and a few dozen 
turns down a long road, but the trip wasn't a chore, because the country itself 
was satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
We missed the house the first time and had to backtrack. We'd have missed it 
again, except a small sign said, "Hill Top House," which my wife recognized 
from the stories. 
</P>
<P>
At first there didn't seem to be any true personality about the place. Slowly 
the lady herself, Beatrix Potter, began to take form as our guide walked us 
through the garden. 
</P>
<P>
"It's patterned after Mr. McGregor's garden," she said. "Does that ring a 
bell?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suddenly Interested 
</P>
<P>
It meant something to most of the visitors, including Joyce, whose interest in 
the garden was suddenly aroused. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's McGregor?" I asked. "Refresh my memory." 
</P>
<P>
No one answered. They were all listening as the guide led us into the house. 
She explained how Miss Potter had lived in an era that expected all proper 
young women to go from their father's house to their husband's. 
</P>
<P>
Beatrix, a very average-looking young lady who spent a good part of her 
growing-up years in the sparsely settled area, had been alone a lot. Having few 
callers and a great deal of time, she had taken to sketching and writing 
stories about the things she knew and loved, like the countryside and some of 
its inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
One of them was a very young rabbit, whom she named Peter. It wasn't much of a 
story. It dealt with Peter leaving his siblings -- Flopsy, Mopsy and 
Cottontail, who were "good little bunnies" -- and going out and losing the new 
coat his mother had made him. 
</P>
<P>
He lost it when he was almost caught by Mr. McGregor, whose garden Peter had 
been told never to visit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Edition 
</P>
<P>
In 1902, probably more on the strength of the sketches than the stories, a 
London publisher took a chance and brought out a limited edition of "The Tale 
of Peter Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
There were no limitations from then on. Beatrix Potter wrote and illustrated 
more than 25 children's books, which were published in dozens of languages, to 
the delight of millions of children. And then their children and their 
children's children. 
</P>
<P>
"Did Beatrix Potter have children of her own?" someone asked. 
</P>
<P>
"She eventually married a man named William Heelis," the guide answered, "but 
she was childless." 
</P>
<P>
A woman asked if Miss Potter had been able to enjoy any of her success, or 
whether fame had only come after her death. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a very canny lady who enjoyed huge success and made a great deal of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Purchased Land 
</P>
<P>
The tour group grew silent. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact," said the guide, "she loved the district so, that to have some 
control over what might happen to it, she began slowly buying up more and more 
property in the area to keep it from being destroyed by what the world calls 
'progress.' 
</P>
<P>
"In addition to her writing, she spent her time working to protect all of this 
part of Cumbria, to keep it pure and unspoiled for all time. Her efforts are 
largely responsible for the fact that this whole district is now under the 
protection of the National Trust. God willing, and thanks to Beatrix Potter, it 
may be protected forever." 
</P>
<P>
The tour ended and we left the house, a few feet behind a young family. As we 
entered the garden again, a bird flew out of the hedge just in front of us. The 
daughter of the family, a girl of perhaps 4 or 5, heard the rustling noise and 
turned quickly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thought She Saw Him 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, papa," she said excitedly. The mother and father stopped and turned. The 
little girl spoke excitedly to her parents in a language neither Joyce nor I 
could understand. Her father answered her and then smiled at us. 
</P>
<P>
"She wants to know was that Peter Rabbit who just came out of the bushes. I 
told her I didn't know because I had not seen." 
</P>
<P>
The little girl thought for a few seconds and then, nodding her head firmly, 
spoke again. Her father translated. 
</P>
<P>
"She says she thinks it was Peter Rabbit, that she thinks she caught a glimpse 
of him." The little girl ran around looking under rose bushes and behind hedges 
for another glimpse as we approached the gate cottage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interesting Theory 
</P>
<P>
Almost as a conspirator, the father shared a final thought with his wife and 
with us. "It probably was not really Peter Rabbit, you know. That rabbit would 
be 85 years old now." He winked. "Probably one of his children or his 
grandchildren, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
Carlin stopped by our dinner table in the hotel dining room that night and 
asked if we'd made it to Hill Top House and what we thought of his theory. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't tell us what the lady had done for the district." 
</P>
<P>
"Or," Joyce said, "that it was Peter Rabbit that really started it all." 
</P>
<P>
"And, I'll bet," Carlin said, "that they told you Beatrix Potter never had any 
children, too." 
</P>
<P>
"You mean she did?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, she had millions of children . . . generations of millions 
of children," he said. "And didn't she leave them a lovely garden to play in?"

MOVIES OF THE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sunday evening movie lineup is one of the strongest in memory, commencing 
at 6 p.m. on Channel 5 with Mel Brooks' hilarious 1974 horror picture spoof, 
Young Frankenstein, with Gene Wilder heading a terrific cast. 
</P>
<P>
Chariots of Fire (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.), the 1981 multi-Oscar winner, 
traces the parallel lives of two very different athletes who became part of the 
remarkable British track and field team at the 1924 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Silent Victory: The Kitty O'Neil Story (Channel 9 Sunday at 7 p.m.) is an 
exceptionally well-made 1979 TV movie with Stockard Channing starring in this 
real-life story about a deaf woman who became one of Hollywood's top stunt 
women. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, Mel Brooks' 1968 debut film The Producers (Channel 5 Sunday at 8 
p.m.) is even funnier than "Young Frankenstein." It's a zany farce in which 
Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder come up with a cockamamie scheme to profit from 
staging a terrible play. 
</P>
<P>
The 1972 Frenzy (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is the finest of Alfred 
Hitchcock's last films, a thriller set in his native London and dealing with a 
man (Jon Finch) wrongly accused of being a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
The Karen Carpenter Story (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) stars Cynthia Gibb in the 
title role of this new TV movie about the popular singer who died at 32 from 
the affects of anorexia nervosa. Mitchell Anderson plays Carpenter's brother 
and singing partner Richard. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Gremlins (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful 
Life" turned inside out, upside down and pickled in brine, a sweet-and-sour 
comedy featuring an invasion of a small Middle American town by a horde of 
fast-multiplying, deceptively cute, furry creatures. 
</P>
<P>
The 14th James Bond adventure A View to a Kill (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a 
so-so affair, with Roger Moore beginning to look a little weary as 007 (Timothy 
Dalton would replace him in the next Bond, the 1987 "Living Daylights"). This 
time the villain is Christopher Walken, intent on destroying Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Watching Terry Gilliam's 1985 Brazil (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), an 
exploding cigar in the face of the future, is like watching Gilliam's head 
erupt in public. Everything that has ever made an impact on the film maker 
seems to be whirling by in this brilliant, exhausting, savagely funny 
post-Orwellian satire, set in the gray confines of the Ministry of Information 
where his shiningly innocent hero (Jonathan Pryce) toils in his cherished 
anonymity. Gilliam's targets are the usual Monty Python concerns: modern 
technology and the men who run it, terrorists, repairmen, bureaucrats, the 
plastic surgery industry, the ad game and sticklers for detail, wherever they 
are. 
</P>
<P>
Terror on Highway 91 (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, stars Ricky 
Schroder in the true story of a young man who exposes police corruption in a 
small southern town. George Dzundza and Matt Clark co-star. 
</P>
<P>
Blake Edwards' 1979 10 (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 10 
p.m.), a modern comedy classic, stars Dudley Moore as a popular composer who, 
in the clutch of middle age, pursues a beautiful young bride (Bo Derek) all the 
way to Mexico, where she is honeymooning. This is a superbly constructed film 
which makes shrewd observations of the American obsession with sex and youth, 
California-style. 
</P>
<P>
The Man in the Brown Suit (CBS Wednesday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie updating 
Agatha Christie's 1924 mystery novel about a young American woman (Stephanie 
Zimbalist) traveling through Egypt in search of adventure. Rue McClanahan, Tony 
Randall and Edward Woodward star. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Reiner's 1984 This Is Spinal Tap (Channel 28 Friday at 11:30 p.m.) is one 
of the funniest movies of the decade, a delicious sendup on the making of a 
rock documentary in which Reiner casts himself as a film maker trying to make a 
record of a seedy English group on tour. The line between parody and reality 
becomes exceedingly and riotously thin. 
</P>
<P>
The dreadful 1986 comedy Armed and Dangerous (CBS Saturday at 8 p.m.) plays 
like a third-generation dupe print of "Police Academy," with frantic splices 
from "Beverly Hills Cop." John Candy and Eugene Levy star as a pair of goofy 
misfits adrift in a Los Angeles populated entirely by bozos, nitwits, boobs and 
cads. 
</P>
<P>
Brian De Palma's 1983 remake of Howard Hawks' 1932 gangster classic Scarface 
(ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.) moves the action from Chicago in the '20s to Miami's 
Cuban community of the present, but for all its operatic razzle-dazzle, it 
becomes a lurid exercise in wretched excess. Al Pacino has the title role as a 
doomed drug kingpin.

'DOUBLE STANDARD' RAISES EYEBROWS IN SHIAS' CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA ABU-NASR, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BAALBEK, Lebanon 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scantily dressed dancers are long gone. The last liquor store was blown up 
six years ago. This ancient Roman city now is the Lebanese capital of Shia 
Muslim fundamentalism. 
</P>
<P>
Public drinking and dancing are forbidden now, but brief male-female unions 
called "pleasure marriages" are condoned. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface at least, life in Baalbek is governed by the dictates of 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's stern brand of Islamic fundamentalism in Iran, 
which to Western eyes appears joyless and forbidding. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing makeup or jewelry in public is taboo. So is singing and dancing at 
mixed gatherings because, as one woman noted, "it causes psychological 
imbalance and tempts men." 
</P>
<P>
But when the sun goes down and the doors are locked, the black robe-like 
chadors Shia women have to wear in public are discarded in favor of shorts and 
strapless tops, along with makeup and perfume. 
</P>
<P>
"People think we're made of stone just because we cover ourselves with chadors. 
But we're not. We're ready to do anything to please our husbands," said Selma, 
a housewife. 
</P>
<P>
Before Lebanon's civil war erupted in 1975, Baalbek was a cultural center where 
dance and theatrical festivals were held in the breathtaking Roman 
amphitheaters. 
</P>
<P>
Now the ruins echo with Islamic slogans as the fundamentalists stage political 
rallies there, chanting ritual denunciations of "Death to America! Death to 
Israel!" The amphitheaters have also been used as mortar positions in Lebanon's 
sectarian fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The Shias' strict life style has drawn bitter criticism from many Lebanese, 
Muslims and Christians alike who say that the fundamentalists' "double 
standards" have brought Islam into disrepute. 
</P>
<P>
Most Shias in Baalbek belong to Hezbollah (Party of God), which is believed to 
be an umbrella for Shia kidnapers holding most of the 16 foreigners missing in 
Lebanon. It's made up of zealots blindly loyal to Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
"We follow whatever Khomeini decrees. Whatever he rejects, we reject," said 
Zeinab Nasser, an administrator at the women's "haouzeh," or religious center, 
in Baalbek. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of pleasure marriage is one of the many customs frowned on by 
other Lebanese, especially moderate Shias and Sunnis. 
</P>
<P>
In a pleasure marriage, a young woman who would not dare expose a curl of her 
hair from under her chador can take on an unlimited number of lovers in the 
name of religion. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the women who take part in pleasure marriages are considered 
respectable and far from promiscuous. 
</P>
<P>
The practice is widespread in Iran, where the overwhelming majority of the 54 
million population is Shia. 
</P>
<P>
Nasser said the Prophet Mohammed sanctioned pleasure marriage, making it 
acceptable for a couple to marry for a specified period that could last "for an 
hour, two days, a month or as long as they desire." 
</P>
<P>
"It's all perfectly legal and provisions are made for any child born after the 
marriage contract expires," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
She said pleasure marriage is especially practical amid Lebanon's economic 
crisis because "men cannot afford a regular marriage, and let's face it, they 
have physical needs. 
</P>
<P>
"If these cannot be met within a permanent marriage, pleasure marriage provides 
the outlet," she added. "It's much better than doing it illicitly." 
</P>
<P>
No cleric is required to perform the ceremony. The woman, who should preferably 
be either divorced or widowed, tells the man, "I give myself to you in 
pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
He responds: "I accept." And that's it. 
</P>
<P>
Virgins need the consent of their parents, but they often do not seek it. 
</P>
<P>
As for forms of entertainment, the fundamentalists permit classical music 
"because it does not have any negative psychological effects," Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
She observed that a scientific report proved that loud music is bad for "the 
nerves and the blood circulation." 
</P>
<P>
Like other factions in Lebanon, where the government has collapsed, the Shias 
have established their own medical and welfare systems, amply funded by Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Abbas Mousavi, a Hezbollah leader, said: "Social work has become one of our 
main responsibilities because of the catastrophes that have befallen Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"We've founded the Imam Khomeini Hospital here, which provides free medical 
treatment. There are similar centers in other Shia areas." 
</P>
<P>
He noted: "We've also founded pharmacies that make a very small profit, as well 
as schools, which we hope will accommodate 6,000 students in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"We've given money to needy families and bought deep-bore drills to provide 
wells in remote villages, especially those we consider to have military or 
political importance." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about complaints on restrictions against alcohol and nightclubs, Mousavi 
noted: "We're not imposing Islamic values on people. No one can say we've 
raided houses where people gamble or drink." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the bombing of liquor stores and clubs, he conceded: "There were 
incidents where young men acted out of Islamic zeal after witnessing aberrant 
behavior. But Hezbollah is against that."

2 MEN SLAIN AS 1988 SHOOTINGS SET A RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two young men were killed and four people wounded as drive-by gunmen and street 
gangs marked the beginning of the long holiday weekend with a series of 
shootings, ending 1988 with record mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend's first fatal shooting occurred at 9 p.m. Friday in South Los 
Angeles, where Raymond Smith, 21, was shot and killed, apparently by occupants 
of a passing car, as he stood in the 200 block of West 84th Street, Lt. Bob 
Hansohn said. Nearby, 20 minutes later, Adam Lopez, 16, was shot to death from 
a passing car as he walked out of a liquor store at 54th and Hoover streets. 
</P>
<P>
The two shootings were not believed to be related. Hansohn, of the 77th Street 
Division, said no suspects had been taken into custody but the shootings "would 
probably turn out to be" gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
Three other shootings, all in an area west of downtown, were apparently 
retaliatory attacks involving two rival gangs, Sgt. Ray Heslop of the Rampart 
Division said Saturday. Those shootings left four people wounded, two of them 
critically. 
</P>
<P>
Heslop said Edward Moran, 21, of Tujunga, was driving past a group of men 
gathered on a front porch on Witmer Street between 3rd and 6th streets at 11:30 
p.m. Friday, when they yelled out gang slogans and fired three shots, Heslop 
said. Moran was hit once in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Ramon Gomez, 24, was standing at the corner of Temple Street and 
Edgeware Road at 1 a.m. Saturday when two men drove past in a car and fired 
three shots from a small caliber revolver, Heslop said. He was wounded in the 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
Heslop said the shooting "was apparently" by the same gang members who had 
fired at Moran from the sidewalk and who had gotten into a car to continue the 
gunplay. 
</P>
<P>
A third shooting, possibly related to the first two, occurred at 2:30 a.m. near 
Crown Hill Street and Loma Drive when several shots were fired from an unknown 
source into a group of young men and women, critically wounding a man in the 
arm and back, and a woman in the chest and back, Heslop said. 
</P>
<P>
Both victims were taken to the County-USC Medical Center. Their names were not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The killings in the 77th Street Division were not included in either the 
Sheriff's or Police Department's preliminary statistics, which indicated 1988 
would end with record totals of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department reported 207 gang killings in the first 10 months of the 
year, a 24.7% jump over the 166 in the same period of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department, which patrols unincorporated areas of Los Angeles 
County and contracts its services to smaller cities, reported 94 gang killings 
in 1988, an 18.1% increase over 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Although police statistics were available only through October, the sheriff's 
report, issued Friday, backed up statements by Sheriff Sherman Block that gang 
violence was on a dramatic rise.

THE YEAR THE AMERICAN MOVIE CAME BACK; 
</P>
<P>
'ACCIDENTAL TOURIST' TOPS THE TIMES' CRITIC'S 10 BEST OF 1988 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are years when a look back over the year's most significant films for 
that arbitrary ten comes with what one writer once called that nasty ratcheting 
sound made by scraping the bottom of the barrel. Then there are years when each 
move to pare down to only 10 brings hours of remorse and deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
And oddly enough, this was one of those killer years. As it warmed up, 1988 may 
not have seemed fated to be an extra superbly choicest year, if you could grade 
movies the way they grade tea. But it gained momentum after a slow first half 
until finally the year could be chalked up as fat, full and innovative. 
</P>
<P>
You cannot fault innovation, not in the same calendar year that marked "Who 
Framed Roger Rabbit" and "Little Dorrit," but full is certainly a big part of 
that equation. Between new screens cropping up like mushrooms after a rain and 
the insatiable maw of video, which insists that movies at least curtsy on a big 
screen before being gulped down into the small one, we are seeing roughly 60 
more films now than we did in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
When you are staring, dumbfounded, at the marshamallowed dimensions of a film 
like "Zelly and Me" it can seem a particularly high psychic price to pay, 
simply to fill more theater screens. Particularly when some of the theaters are 
roughly the size of an airline washroom, and flood with light whenever 
late-comers shuffle into to one of their 45 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Then a film like "The Chocolate War" gets its crack at one of those screens, 
giving audiences a chance to discover the strengths of its astonishingly 
assured young debuting director, Keith Gordon, and it all seems worth it again. 
</P>
<P>
1988 may be remembered as the point at which the quintessentially American 
movie came back into its own, giving us the outright delights of "Punchline," 
"Bull Durham," "Big," "8 Men Out," "Roger Rabbit," "Dominick and Eugene," 
"Tucker" or " Working Girl." 
</P>
<P>
It was also the year for films adapted from exceptionally knotty books, and 
succeed or fail, the determination involved in "The Unbearable Lightness of 
Being," "The Accidental Tourist," "Little Dorrit," "The Milagro Beanfield War," 
"Pelle the Conqueror" and "The Last Temptation of Christ" had to be admired. 
</P>
<P>
Art, music and even food had their day on the screen with "The Moderns," 
"Vincent," "Bird" "Long Live the Lady" and "Babette's Feast." By and large, 
films with urgent social or political issues still came with passports or not 
at all: "A World Apart," "Hotel Terminus: the Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," 
"A Cry in the Dark," "Salaam Bombay!" In some cases it was a foreign-born 
director who took on American social issues, the case of "Betrayed" and 
"Mississippi Burning." 
</P>
<P>
The 10 films that impressed me most this year are below, ranked in order, with 
special notice that "Punchline" very nearly threw the whole matter into a tie. 
So, the runner up-list is a hair's breath one this year. 
</P>
<P>
1. "It's not just how much you love someone," William Hurt as a grieving father 
muses in "The Accidental Tourist," "it's who you are when you're with them." 
Director-co-writer Lawrence Kasdan has made watching this man come alive, 
perhaps for the first time, into a small-scale epiphany. What's startling is 
how this story, which takes place during Hurt's second year of mourning, can be 
as funny as it is. However, like Anne Tyler's singular book, the humor comes 
from character and the family Hurt springs from is memorable enough to have 
escaped from Dickens. Among the excellent ensemble, all of whom seem to have a 
decidedly droll bent and a knack for underplaying, you can find the 
irresistible Geena Davis. She plays a dog obedience trainer to whom Hurt's 
Welsh corgi, Edward, takes an enormous shine. It's entirely understandable. 
</P>
<P>
2. "Little Dorrit's" virtues are not simply its off-handed display of the cream 
of British actors: Derek Jacobi, Alec Guinness, Miriam Margolyes, Roshan Seth, 
Joan Greenwood, Eleanor Bron, Cyril Cusack, but the toughness and 
accomplishment with which director Christine Edzard's adaptation makes Dickens 
as pertinent as this week's stock-fixing headlines. 
</P>
<P>
The qualities which made George Bernard Shaw call the novel "more seditious 
than "Das Kapital" are here in abundance and Edzard asks that we see the story 
in two films, six hours in all; however her method is not epic but intimate. By 
the time we have come to Dorrit's triumphant conclusion, the faces, and voices 
of London at that time, the working poor as well as the drawling rich, have 
been stamped upon us forever. 
</P>
<P>
3. "A Cry in the Dark" is an angry film, an outraged one really, as director 
Fred Schepisi lays out the almost unbelieveable path of Australian 
jurisprudence and/or media hijinks by which a bereft mother became, in the eyes 
of the public, the ritual killer of her own infant daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Its power comes from Schepisi's blend of passion and detachment and from the 
best performance Meryl Streep has given so far. (Do we seem to write this each 
year? If so, it's true -- this is a talent you can watch deepen and become 
further refined with each role.) Streep has a perfectly matched thoroughbred 
opposite her in Sam Neill; he makes this Seventh Day Adventist pastor's fall 
from smugness and self-assurance a wracking business. 
</P>
<P>
4. "Salaam, Bombay!" throws us into the life of Bombay's street kids with an 
ebullience and an energy that's matched exactly by the film's tough-mindedness. 
Director Mira Nair asks for no pity for her urchins and she doesn't romanticize 
them either, but there is no way you cannot be haunted by them. "Salaam 
Bombay!" is not Nair's first film about exploitation as a way of life in 
India's cities, but it is her first non-documentary and she brings to her work 
a wonderful eye and a truly cinematic flair for story telling. As you leave 
10-year old Krishna, you may be reminded of "The 400 Blows," sacrilegious as 
that may sound. But "Salaam Bombay!" didn't win Nair the Camera D'Or at Cannes 
in 1988, for best new director, for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
5. In a year of largely literal films, the poetry of Wim Wenders' "Wings of 
Desire" soars, on the wings of his two Berliner angels, with Peter Handke's 
screenplay and with the camera of Henri Alekan, who might be considered 
something of an expert on black and white fairy tales, since it was he who also 
photographed "Beauty and the Beast." Peter Falk gives the film a wry, gutsy 
center, but its essence is its passionate declaration of the need for trust, 
love and commitment; a cheerfully anachronistic, contagiously optimistic tack. 
6. In a way, Austrian director Percy Adlon was working on the same wavelength 
in "Bagdad Cafe" that Wenders was in "Wings of Desire," although Adlon was 
playing a little more with the elements of personal discovery. Those qualities 
make "Bagdad Cafe" a slow-burning fuse, whose charm grows on you like its great 
and haunting song, "I'm Calling You." 
</P>
<P>
Its story of two heartily unalike women, the American CCH Pounder, the Bavarian 
Marianne Sagebrecht, who meet and join forces against a largely disinterested 
world in the California desert, depends largely on the charm of ex-cabaret 
artist Sagebrecht and long-time theater actress Pounder. Both of them are 
exceptional, but Sagebrecht carries a special something extra, as anyone who 
saw her in "Sugarbaby" will remember. 
</P>
<P>
7. Ostensibly about a "failed" car manufacturer, "Tucker," is Francis Ford 
Coppola's tribute to America's loners, its dreamers, whether they make 
ballpoint pens, or vast unflyable airplanes like the film's enigma, Howard 
Hughes. (Or, by the smallest stretch, if they make roundly disliked movies.) 
Loose-limbed and innovative, fueled by a full-throttle performance by Jeff 
Bridges as Tucker, it's a film that could have used more of the darker tones of 
Tucker's life -- heaven knows there were enough of them. But scenes like the 
launching of "The car of tomorrow, today" or the mysterioso meeting between 
Tucker and Dean Stockwell's Howard Hughes do a lot toward shutting down minor 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
8. The beauty and control David Cronenberg uses to tell his melancholy, macabre 
tale of symbiotic twin doctors in "Dead Ringers" shows the director at a new 
high of maturity, and Jeremy Irons' dual portrayal as one bordering on the 
eerie. Dealing, again, with the body, its mysteries and its final frightening 
independence from what we would have it do, "Dead Ringers"' twins are loosely 
based on a real Manhattan pair, but they are more plainly metaphors for any 
relationship that begins in love and ends in pathology. To think of a film this 
assured, this unified and this dizzyingly potent, you have to go back to "Blue 
Velvet." 
</P>
<P>
9. "Red Sorghum" makes you suspect that its director, 37-year old Zhang Yimou, 
was cinema-doomed from the cradle: His saga, which ends during the Japanese 
invasion of China, is part folk-tale, part love story and completely thrilling 
to behold. To credit this as Zhang's directorial debut is not to tell the whole 
story: before this he has also been a masterly cinematographer ("Yellow Earth," 
"The Big Parade) and an actor whose performance in "The Old Well" won him first 
prize at Tokyo's Film Festival. It's especially interesting to see a film from 
modern China with the scale and sensibilities about nature of the Kurosawa of 
"Dersu Uzala." 
</P>
<P>
10. After you see "A World Apart" you realize that the great film about South 
Africa is still waiting to be made. However, this personal one, the homage by a 
daughter to her martyred mother -- the first white woman jailed under South 
Africa's 90-day detention law -- as empathetically directed by Chris Menges, is 
a firm step in that direction. Three memorably fine performances came out of 
this: Barbara Hershey and young Jodhi May as mother and daughter; Linda Mvusi 
as their housekeeper. If somehow the facts of existence in South Africa had 
escaped you, " A World Apart" might be the perfect place to start. 
</P>
<P>
Those hotly close runners-up are "Punchline," "The Moderns," "Babette's Feast," 
"8 Men Out," "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," "Last Temptation of 
Christ," "Hotel Terminus: the Life and times of Klaus Barbie," "Track 29," 
"Vincent" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit."

A surprising amount of good work got done in Los Angeles theater in 1988, 
considering that it was a war year. 
</P>
<P>
For months, Actors' Equity and the smaller theaters fought out the question of 
how to compensate Waiver actors. This at least established the principle that 
Waiver actors deserved compensation. But it also used up a lot of energy. By 
year's end, you had to hope that the Waiver wars were winding down: Everybody 
was sick of them. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the smaller theaters got on with it. A fine young writer named Jamie 
Baker had a double debut. His "Don't Go Back to Rockville" was first seen at 
the Pacific Theatre Ensemble, then at the Victory Theatre. Set in 1944, it 
concerned a surly young Kentucky Derby jockey named Ed (Andrew Philpot). His 
unaffectionate progeny turned up a few months later at the Tamarind Theater in 
Baker's "South Central Rain." 
</P>
<P>
Ed and his nasty-nice spawn didn't have a lot to recommend them as human 
beings, but they had a sneaky vitality as stage characters. They suggested 
Lanford Wilson's Talley clan, except that they didn't come off as "characters," 
but as people with real needs -- even if selfish ones. Volume Three of this 
family saga is awaited with interest. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Lima also hit the mark with "El Salvador" at the Gnu Theatre. The scene 
here was a hotel room from which a group of journalists were trying to cover 
the war in El Salvador without getting their heads shot off, and the message 
was that this kind of life can get to be addictive. An oddly effective 
combination of "The Front Page" and "Apocalypse Now," tautly directed by the 
Gnu's Jeff Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
It was an election year, and the Bush-Dukakis debates provided playacting of a 
dim sort. But there weren't many overtly political plays. Jeff Goldsmith's 
"McCarthy" at the Odyssey came closest, a somewhat overwritten script, but with 
two lean and mean performances: Victor Brandt as Tail Gunner Joe and Ralph 
Seymour as Roy Cohn. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS remained a scourge. "Jerker" -- the notorious script by Robert Chesley 
that the FCC had found pornographic when it was performed on KPFK -- got a live 
production at the Fifth Estate Theatre. It ended with a tired voice saying, 
over a Judy Garland record, that he couldn't come to the phone right now but 
please leave a message. No more needed to be said. 
</P>
<P>
In larger theaters, the best work, and certainly the most work, was done by the 
Los Angeles Theatre Center. Not everything that LATC attempted came off, but 
each of its shows had a reason for being and left a sense that somebody at the 
theater was in its corner. 
</P>
<P>
LATC introduced us to two playwrights with imagination and control, Jose Rivera 
and Marlane Meyer. Rivera was born in Puetro Rico, and his "The Promise" was a 
wild juxtaposition of family drama and tall tale, set in a world as real as a 
rusty muffler, yet a world where demons came and went. Marlane Meyer gave us 
two plays, "Etta Jenks" and "Kingfish." The first brought back to life the 
cliche of the girl who goes to the dogs when she tries to break into the 
movies. Meyer's script worked because it dealt with the grungy Hollywood that 
actually exists, as opposed to the Oz of popular imagination; and because Meyer 
didn't waste any time sentimentalizing over Etta. (Actress Deirdre O'Connell 
didn't sentimentalize her, either.) 
</P>
<P>
"Kingfish" concerned a non-existent dog who nonetheless existed, since it was 
to the interest of certain parties that he do so. This could have been a 
terribly precious play. Perhaps the conceptual framework imposed on it by 
director David Schweizer was a bit precious. But, again, Meyer knew her people. 
She knew, for instance, that a lonely bachelor (Buck Henry) might covet a son 
(Merritt Butrick) so badly that he would pay to have one. This script didn't go 
any farther out than human behavior does. We're just not used to seeing it go 
this far in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
LATC also took on the Russians. Stein Winge's nightmarish production of "The 
Inspector General" got all tangled up in its bedclothes, but Ron Campbell 
proved wonderfully idiotic in the lead. Charles Marowitz's staging of "The Sea 
Gull" was dead-on: a production that called Chekhov's characters to account, 
rather than issuing them a blanket pardon because they were all so sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bushnell's staging of Alexander Galin's "Stars in the Morning Sky" didn't 
redeem a pedestrian script about some played-out whores in "protective custody" 
during the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Nevertheless, as with "Sarcophagus" in '87, 
the play was an interesting theater event -- further proof that Soviet 
playwrights no longer have to pretend that they live in Utopia. 
</P>
<P>
This was the pattern at LATC last year: Even when the play fell short, the 
viewer could grab onto something. Another example: Chloe Webb's exuberant 
performance as the schizophrenic daughter in "The Model Apartment." LATC is on 
a roll these days: You can feel the energy in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
The only time you felt that energy in the Mark Taper Forum lobby in '88 was 
after "The Colored Museum." Younger viewers, black and white, had been 
exhilarated by the anger in George C. Wolfe's script, while older people 
suspected that Wolfe was reviving the hurtful black stereotypes of the past, 
under the guise of satirizing them. 
</P>
<P>
Few other Taper plays proved so stimulating: Certainly not its yuppified 
production of George Walker's "Nothing Sacred." It was good to see Joe Chaikin 
back at Taper, Too. Director Robert Woodruff kept Sam Shepard's loose-jointed 
"A Lie of the Mind" all in one piece. Ron Taylor gave a tremendous supporting 
performance in 
</P>
<P>
"Lost Highway." But it was a season that said "Me, too" rather than, as in the 
old days at the Taper, "Look at this!" Or are we romanticizing the old days? 
</P>
<P>
"Fences" was the Doolittle's big hit, with James Earl Jones even more resonant 
than he had been on Broadway, and Lynne Thigpen taking no garbage as his wife. 
Another August Wilson play, "Joe Turner's Come and Gone," played the Old Globe 
Theatre prior to Broadway, with Delroy Lindo as a self-flaying fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Playhouse, once given up for dead, had a fine year. Amanda McBroom 
starred in the splendid "Lies and Legends," based on Harry Chapin's songs. The 
show later transferred to Beverly Hills. We can't understand why Robert 
Harling's beauty-parlor comedy "Steel Magnolias" didn't make a similar 
transfer. Barbara Rush and the rest of the cast loved doing it, the audience 
loved watching it, and even a critic had to acknowledge that behind the sitcom 
rhythms, there was a genuine admiration here for the way women can get it 
together. 
</P>
<P>
As opposed to men. Jules Feiffer's "Carnal Knowledge" at the Playhouse had 
Gregory Harrison and David Marshall Grant as two guys who treat women like The 
Enemy, and end up sandbagging themselves. This was also the predicament of Sean 
Penn, Danny Aiello and the other scuzzy Hollywood guys in "Hurlyburly," staged 
by playwright David Rabe at the Westwood Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Disgracefully, the "Hurlyburly" company canceled a performance just before 
curtain-time, the excuse being that their friend Gary Busey had just had a 
motorcycle accident. The professional reaction, in this circumstance, is to 
dedicate the performance to your friend and go on. Nonetheless, Penn and his 
colleagues -- including Mare Winningham as the toughest of their lady friends 
-- gave "Hurlyburly" one hell of a ride. 
</P>
<P>
The funniest classical revival of the year was South Coast Repertory's "School 
for Scandal," which director Paul Marcus set in a strange land where 
18th-Century types read the National Enquirer. SCR also brought us an urgent 
revival of "The Crucible," directed by Martin Benson -- one of those shows 
where the audience gasps even when it knows what's coming next. In San Diego, 
the show of the year was the San Diego Repertory Theatre's "Red Noses," Peter 
Barnes' black comedy about the uses of comedy in a bad time. Co-produced with 
the Dell'Arte Players of Blue Lake, Calif., the production combined expert 
clowning and scathing satire. Only one show gave us more pure pleasure during 
1988 -- the Moscow Circus.

BASKETBALL RACE SHAPES UP AS RERUN; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENDING CHAMPIONS VENTURA, SANTA MONICA FAVORED IN REALIGNED WSC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Santa Monica and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
That is the answer, which comes without hesitation, from Western State 
Conference basketball coaches asked to name the favorites in this season's race 
for the WSC title. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two are head and shoulders above everyone else in the conference 
talent-wise," Glendale Coach Brian Beauchemin said. "Everybody else is right 
there together." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica and Ventura shared the championship last season with 11-2 records, 
and no one affiliated with the conference is bold enough to predict that it 
might not be a similar scenario this time around. 
</P>
<P>
The WSC has been slightly realigned after the defection of Allan Hancock 
College to the Central Valley Conference and the entry of Valley and West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Valley, which played in the Southern California Conference last season, and 
West L. A. will join the South Division, which also includes Santa Monica, 
Canyons, Glendale and Bakersfield. The North Division comprises Ventura, 
Moorpark, Cuesta, Santa Barbara and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Coach John McMullen grudgingly admits that his Corsairs may be the 
team to beat. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose on our preseason record and returning lettermen that's the case," 
said McMullen, whose team is 15-3 and has won the Rancho Santiago, Compton, 
Merced and Pasadena tournaments. "If that's true, we're not that far ahead of 
anybody else. I've seen Valley, Canyons, Moorpark and Glendale, and they're all 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, all of the Valley-area teams have tasted success during the 
preconference schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (9-8), though plagued by inconsistency, has looked spectacular at 
times. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars finished 8-5 in the WSC last season and made the playoffs for the 
fourth year in a row. This season, they finished second in the Glendale 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Smelser, in his 20th season as coach at Canyons, said the WSC likely will 
be one of the best conferences in the state. Whether his team will be among the 
best in the conference, however, will depend on its ability to eliminate 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a manner of transition, trying to be halfway decent and struggling," 
said Smelser, whose team opens WSC play Tuesday at West L. A. "We haven't been 
able to put the whole package together. That's been kind of frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
For a variety of reasons, Glendale (9-6) lost 4 players -- potentially, a 
strong nucleus -- from a young team that finished 6-7 in the WSC last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros, who open WSC play Wednesday at Santa Monica, are once again a 
young outfit, but the team has shown steady improvement despite its youth. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing all right considering what happened," said Beauchemin, who is in 
his 10th season with the Vaqueros. "The players are starting to respond." 
</P>
<P>
Valley (10-6), which joins the WSC after competing in the Southern California 
Conference, has a talented team led by center Oral Elrington and could give 
some teams trouble if the Monarchs are able to develop depth. Valley's first 
test comes Wednesday at Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (8-7 entering the weekend), though dominated by freshmen, should 
improve steadily under Al Nordquist, who is in his 22nd season with the 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Roger Thomas, a freshman from Leuzinger High, is averaging 10.9 
points a game to lead the Raiders. Moorpark opens its conference schedule 
Wednesday at home against Cuesta. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard, which finished 1-12 last season, is the most improved team in the WSC. 
Santa Barbara won its own tournament and also is considered a conference dark 
horse. 
</P>
<P>
But in a conference with Santa Monica and Ventura, every team is a long-shot to 
displace the reigning co-champions. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura (13-2 entering the weekend) might have lost conference MVP Cedric 
Ceballos, but the Pirates have been buoyed by the play of all-conference point 
guard Tony Walker, who is averaging 9.6 assists, and freshman forward Reggie 
Betton, who is averaging 13.9 points. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, which opens WSC play Wednesday at Santa Barbara, has won the Cypress 
and Ventura tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica has 7 players back from a team that lost to Merced in the 
quarterfinals of the state tournament last season, including All-WSC forward 
Keith Amerson, forwards Von Shuler and Kemo Patrick and guards DeShawn Pullard 
and Troy Batiste, all of whom average more than 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks to me as if this is one of the strongest conferences overall in 
Southern California," McMullen said. "I feel that everybody has a team that can 
beat anybody else on a given night."

A WILDCATTER STRIKES AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
AT 72, ARCO FOUNDER ROBERT ANDERSON IS BUILDING A SECOND EMPIRE AT PAULEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first time Robert O. Anderson started an oil company, things were simpler. 
</P>
<P>
In 1942, all he needed was $150,000 in capital, a couple of partners and $1,400 
in drilling rig equipment. He packed up his belongings and his new wife and 
daughter and drove half a continent from his native Chicago to settle in the 
arid desert of New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
It worked out pretty well. After 25 years as an independent oilman and 
wildcatter, Anderson helped create and run Atlantic Richfield Co., which grew 
into the seventh-largest oil company in the country before Anderson left in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
On the way, Anderson's annual income as Arco's chairman exceeded $1 million a 
year. He became a land baron, patron of the arts, adviser to presidents and an 
unmistakable industry presence in his trademark bow tie and well-worn Stetson. 
</P>
<P>
Now 72, Anderson could have retired to the solitude of his beloved New Mexico 
ranch, where he still tools around in the 1949 Oldsmobile convertible that was 
a perk in a long-ago deal. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he is trying again to build an oil company the way he did in the 
beginning -- from the ground up. "I happen to think that a rocking chair and a 
television screen are a quick way to the graveyard," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, Anderson assumed control of tiny Pauley Petroleum Inc. by 
merging his private Hondo Oil &amp; Gas Co. with Pauley in a deal valued at the 
time at about $42 million. Pauley was founded by the late Edwin W. Pauley, 
himself a Los Angeles millionaire oil entrepreneur and presidential adviser 
perhaps best known as the namesake of UCLA's basketball pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, eager to recapture the hands-on feel of the oil business he had lost 
as chairman of Arco, aims to transform Pauley from a moribund refiner and 
producer into a fully integrated oil company. "In a sense, I guess it is 
starting all over again -- or picking up where I left off, depending on how you 
look at it," he said last week in Pauley's small Westwood office. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a year and a half since the merger, and he may be finding that it's 
not as easy as it was the first time around. "Everything's running, but not 
quite the way we want it yet. . . . For some reason, things just don't move as 
fast; things are bigger, more complicated I guess," he said. "But patience is 
the key to it all." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has already transformed Pauley into a company resembling his earliest 
oil ventures. Like them, Pauley has oil and gas holdings largely in the 
Rockies, New Mexico and Texas, and is focusing primarily on exploring and 
drilling for oil. 
</P>
<P>
Because of exploration costs, debt-servicing costs, and depressed crude and 
refined product prices, the company reported a loss of $9.5 million in the 
first six months of fiscal 1989 on revenue of $151 million. That compares to 
net income of $4.6 million on revenue of $65.8 million in the year earlier 
period. 
</P>
<P>
But Anderson and other industry insiders feel that Pauley's fortunes should 
turn around now that oil prices are easing back up and with expectations that 
natural gas demand should grow. "Next year will be the first year we'll have 
the opportunity to put the whole thing together," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Anderson is leading a move quietly to divest Pauley, 
headquartered for many years in the Los Angeles area, of all its local 
holdings, including its Newhall refinery, said William R. Pagen, Pauley's 
former chairman and now part-time vice chairman. The company's headquarters 
have already moved to Roswell, New Mexico, the base of all Anderson's 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his Westwood office, Anderson seems every bit the oil executive in 
his tailored blue suit. His hair has gone white, and his speech is more 
measured than it once was, although he still discourses easily on subjects from 
global warming to natural gas supplies to corporate dividend policies. 
</P>
<P>
But then he smiles as he picks up his battered hat, fingers a fishing fly in 
the band and abruptly interrupts a conversation: "That's a Rat-faced 
McDougall," he says with a laugh. "With a hair body." 
</P>
<P>
Why would a man so enamored of fly fishing want to get back into oil 
prospecting? "You don't get involved in this business in the first place unless 
there's something burning in you to go out and drill holes in the ground and 
risk everything in a venture," said H. R. (Bud) Scoggins, president of the 
Independent Petroleum Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
That urge is what drove Anderson, the son of a Chicago banker, to spend summers 
away from the University of Chicago on oil pipeline crews in Texas, shoulder to 
shoulder with the roughnecks in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refining Company Partner 
</P>
<P>
In 1942, he bought into a partnership in a small refining company in Artesia, 
New Mexico. During the war, Anderson sold jet fuel to the nearby Army Air Corps 
station and delivered diesel fuel to a mysterious government camp in nearby Los 
Alamos. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife were in their mountain cabin about 50 miles away when the early 
morning atomic blast from the camp lit up the room like daylight, he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Anderson completed a series of deals that increased his 
holdings of both oil and gas properties, refineries and retail outlets. He 
moved his base of operations to Roswell, New Mexico, and began acquiring land 
and livestock for his ranching interests. 
</P>
<P>
"I live in the country because I'm very sensitive to the environment," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1950s, Anderson's Hondo Oil &amp; Gas Co. struck oil in the 
Empire-Abo oil field, one of the largest in the Southwest, with 250 million 
barrels in reserve. His holdings in the field caught the attention of 
crude-starved Atlantic Refining Co. of Philadelphia. In 1962, Hondo merged with 
Atlantic, giving Anderson stock worth $32 million, making him the company's 
largest shareholder and putting him on the track to the chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appalling Discovery 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, the independent oilman, was appalled to discover that many of the 
Philadelphia executives were unfamiliar with routine oil field jargon. 
Throughout his career, he worked to erase the gap between the executive suites 
and the drilling rigs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, shortly after his election as chairman, Anderson and President 
Thornton Bradshaw used a transatlantic plane trip to formulate a six-point 
strategy that was to eventually see the company through its greatest period of 
growth. That strategy included focusing on key areas of the business and 
keeping them in balance. 
</P>
<P>
"Most companies don't take an objective view of what they do," he said. "But I 
think a company should philosophically review its activities and what it's 
doing every few years. If you don't, certain segments of a company will grow 
faster than the rest." 
</P>
<P>
A fishing trip with Charlie Jones, chairman of the Richfield Oil Corp. cemented 
the merger that would create Arco and bring the company its greatest asset: 
leases on the North Slope of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson made his first trip to the North Slope in 1966, wearing a suit and 
carrying his boots and jeans in a duffel bag, he recalled. At the time, many 
oil companies had abandoned unsuccessful efforts to find oil there -- and Arco, 
under Anderson's direction, was among the last to drill exploratory wells. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prepared to be Wrong 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that if we hadn't made a discovery, it would have been the 
last well drilled on the North Slope for a good many years," he recalled of the 
decision to proceed after a series of failures. "But you shouldn't be an 
explorer for oil and gas unless you're prepared to be wrong 80% or 90% of the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Arco under Anderson's chairmanship would be one of the players in 
the costly and frustrating construction of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. 
Anderson recalls the high emotions surrounding the proposed pipeline: during 
one speech in Washington, a young woman walked up and doused him with a can of 
motor oil. 
</P>
<P>
During this time, Anderson became one of the largest landowners in the world. 
He still owns major ranches in New Mexico and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
He advised and befriended presidents, became an active figure in Republican 
politics and was considered for numerous civic appointments. 
</P>
<P>
The namesake of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's newest wing, he also 
became known for his devotion to the arts and world affairs, a passion he 
imprinted on Arco as well. He chaired dozens of cultural groups, helped revive 
the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, underwrote research into global 
problems and engineered bailouts of respected but financially troubled 
publications like the London Observer and Harper's magazine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grabbing the Public Eye 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, Bradshaw seemed to grab more of the public's attention. But even 
that was part of Anderson's design. At his busiest, Anderson devoted only a 
couple of days a week to Arco and traveled as much as 500 miles a day. A given 
week might take him from an Arco board meeting in Los Angeles to a seminar at 
the Aspen Institute in Colorado to his ranch in Roswell to spend time with his 
wife, Barbara, his two sons and five daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, he estimates, he devotes a third of his time to interests outside 
Pauley and still travels several thousand miles a year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, as crude oil prices were poised to plunge and oil company takeovers 
were in the wind, Anderson was part of the management team that engineered a 
major restructuring of Arco that included a major stock repurchase, staff 
reductions, divestment of Eastern retailing and refining operations and 
curtailment of exploration. Later that year, Anderson resigned his 
chairmanship, and in 1986, left the company completely. 
</P>
<P>
"He left a company that was very well poised to take advantage of a very tricky 
environment," said oil consultant Thomas Wachtell. 
</P>
<P>
Current Arco executives declined to discuss Anderson's new venture, but Arco 
Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook said in a statement: "Bob left us a firm foundation 
on which to build, and we are grateful for his leadership during those pivotal 
years." 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Arco in 1986, Anderson and the British conglomerate Lonrho PLC 
bought some of Arco's marginal oil and gas properties for an estimated $180 
million in a bidding process that drew some criticism and a shareholder lawsuit 
that was later dismissed. At the time, critics accused Anderson of having 
insider knowledge about certain drilling rights that were not listed for sale 
-- charges Anderson denied. The drilling rights were eventually sold back to 
Arco. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a cat and dog collection that still needs some sorting out," he says. 
"But it made good sense from the point of view of an independent company. . . . 
A small company can operate properties like that better than a big company." 
</P>
<P>
With the properties, Anderson reconstituted his old Hondo Co., with Lonrho 
holding a little less than half interest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assuming Control 
</P>

Anderson assumed control of Pauley in January, 1988, when Anderson's Hondo Co. 
received 10 million shares, or about 77%, of Pauley's outstanding common stock, 
in exchange for which Pauley took over Hondo's oil and gas subsidiary. With 
other purchases, Hondo eventually ended up holding about 81% of Pauley's stock. 
</P>
<P>
In the merger, Pauley gained Hondo's sizable oil and gas reserves in the Arco 
properties. Pauley's reserves stood at 16.7 million barrels of oil and 108.7 
billion cubic feet of natural gas at the end of the last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the company has pursued an aggressive drilling program, 
drilling about 39 new wells a year, Pagen said. About $18 million is slated for 
drilling in fiscal 1989, with $12 million going to new prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he intends to remain actively involved in the company's 
management, though he maintains a stiff travel schedule. He has cut back on 
many of his outside involvements, preferring to concentrate his activities in 
New Mexico. He has also sold off his foreign land holdings and most of his 
outside business interests. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has involved his two sons, Phelps, 38, and Robert B., 42, in the 
management of his new company. Each is also an officer of Hondo and owns about 
5% of that company. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons I decided to go back into the business was my two very 
bright young sons," he says. Asked whether he'd like them to mirror his own 
career, he says simply, "That would please me very much."

TOCQUEVILLE A BIOGRAPHY BY ANDRE JARDIN; TRANSLATED BY LYDIA DAVIS WITH ROBERT 
HEMENWAY(FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $30; 548 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Annette J. Smith and David R. Smith , Both Smiths are professors at Caltech 
and co-translators and editors of 'Mademoiselle Irnois' and Other Stories by 
Arthur de Gobineau (University of California Press), who was, among other 
things, Tocqueville's secretary. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andre Jardin's "Tocqueville," surprisingly the first full-scale biography of 
this major 19th-Century figure, is a fine, old-fashioned piece of work, some of 
it original, much of it taken from the ample precedent scholarship. It provides 
an abundant store of information and an occasional surprise -- a dozen years 
after its publication, we find the author of "Democracy in America," now 
minister of foreign affairs, exclaiming: "But what animals these Americans 
are!" 
</P>
<P>
It is as the author of "Democracy in America" that Tocqueville is known in this 
country; but what this biography reveals is not so much an admirer of America 
as a Frenchman of his time, circumstance and needs, even when he is in America. 
He came here with his friend Beaumont ostensibly as a student of penitentiary 
reform, but Tocqueville really wanted to take a larger look at this new 
republic, since it was clear to him that the European drift was in that 
direction, and what intrigued him was its democratic base, since he had been 
brought up to believe that a republic could function only when run by a 
virtuous elite. We know what he found and how he responded, but the biography 
also reveals, almost inadvertently, why he was such an accurate and 
comparatively unbiased observer. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he had not biased himself by reading contemporary travel 
literature, much of it written by snide Tories pretending to take an 
unprejudiced look at the American experiment. Capt. Basil Hall's infamous 
"Travels" had been only partially translated (the chapter on prison reform) 
into French, and, in any event, it was his companion Beaumont who read it. The 
result was that Tocqueville's vision had not been prejudiced (other than by his 
relative Chateaubriand's romance with New World nature). For another, 
Tocqueville and Beaumont readied themselves each day by preparing questions for 
the people they would meet, questions based upon their own observations sur 
place and designed to elicit responses useful to them as Frenchmen trying to 
prepare themselves for a possible future. They were not, as were the Tories, 
justifying a past. 
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville's Cartesian clarity, his relative lack of bias, meant that he used 
the answers to his questions to form a useful statement about America, but the 
questions themselves and their reasons reveal perhaps even more about France. 
By looking at this intelligent, open-minded, and inquiring young civil servant 
and nobleman of impeccable political parentage (great grandson of Malesherbes), 
Jardin's book provides the American reader a marvelous introduction to the 
political shiftings, the gradual yet sometimes violent post-revolutionary 
cracking of the political structure in France as it grappled simultaneously 
with the shattered legitimacy of the past, a slippery present and an 
ill-defined future. 
</P>
<P>
After the immediate success of "Democracy in America" (1835), Tocqueville 
entered the political arena and was elected deputy for the arrondissement of 
Valognes, the region of his family castle in Normandy. He sat left of center in 
the Chamber. Although many at the time thought of him as an Carlist aristocrat 
and some in this country think of him as an American-style conservative, 
Tocqueville considered the old aristocracy "dead for ever." Over the years, he 
demonstrated his liberalism by fighting for parliamentary monarchy, separation 
of church and state, reform of the suffrage laws, improvement of the worker's 
lot, for liberalizing public education, abolishing slavery wherever it existed, 
improving the prison system and eliminating poverty. He managed, nevertheless, 
to stay clear of several more powerful champions of liberal causes such as 
Lamartine, Royer-Collard, and Thiers, who would have liked to have him on their 
side but whose egos he mistrusted. 
</P>
<P>
Independence is what most characterizes Tocqueville's career. A colleague 
reproached him for "giving the right hand to the left, the left to the right 
and regretting that he does not have a third one to give invisibly." "Freedom 
is the strongest of my passions. Voila. It is the truth," he explained to 
disconcerted observers. If he moved left, it was, he claimed, to impose his 
color on the left, not change his own. 
</P>
<P>
Another constant was his hatred of centralization. In "L'Ancien Regime et la 
Revolution," Tocqueville analyzed the roots of centralization in France, which 
according to him went as far back as the reign of Philip the Fair in the Middle 
Ages. He lamented the fact that centralization had destroyed time-tested local 
organic structures and that the French nobility itself was at fault in the 
process. Tocqueville fought centralism in all of its manifestations as he saw 
them. For instance, rather an agnostic himself, he defended religious education 
because he believed in the healthy necessity of a third force besides the state 
and the people. 
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville's anticentralism colored his responses to the various colonial 
enterprises that characterize European history of the period. Thus, in newly 
conquered Algeria, he favored a kind of settlement based on local autonomy 
rather than central metropolitan power. He was the first man in the Chamber to 
push for a separate ministry for Algeria -- a dream that became a fact only a 
century later in Leon Blum's cabinet. He deplored the downfall of the Ottoman 
Empire in the Middle East, since the Turks were not only a desirable bumper 
between the major European predators, but also relatively tolerant themselves 
toward the diversity of their possessions. He admired the respect for local 
customs that the British had shown in India. 
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville was an active, intelligent legislator, esteemed particularly for 
his work on penitentiary reform (inspired by the Philadelphia system) and on 
the abolition of slavery, but he was not a sensational figurehead. One might 
say that, like Montaigne, he had lived through a great deal of political 
turmoil and managed to preserve an independent judgment. When Louis-Napoleon 
was propelled into the presidency at the end of the bloody 1848 revolution, 
Tocqueville was given the foreign affairs ministry in the Barrot cabinet. He 
served with the same unsensational distinction as in the Chamber but was fired 
after only five months. He had protested Louis-Napoleon's coup d'etat that made 
an emperor of the president and was briefly imprisoned in Vincennes -- luckier 
in this than one of our great-grandfathers, who was sent to the Sahara for the 
same offense. From then to his death from tuberculosis in Cannes in 1859, 
Tocqueville led the life of a gentleman farmer and journalist who, amid 
numerous changes of residence to accommodate his health, wrote (but did not 
finish) "L'Ancien Regime et la Revolution." 
</P>
<P>
This long and scrupulous study of a man who was one of the most profound and 
prophetic thinkers of his time, is, alas, scrupulous to the point of boredom. 
The narration rarely deviates from an inexhaustible concatenation of facts 
related in the soberest of prose. Although it does justice to Tocqueville's 
ideas, it fails in rendering the passion and the grace of his intellectual life 
and the social brilliance of the era. Moreover, the book is curiously 
organized: The order followed a mixture of the chronological and of the 
thematic, with several baffling leaps from one to the other. Andre Jardin's 
work constitutes an excellent work of reference for the scholar. It is indexed 
and substantially but not cumbersomely footnoted. Still it makes the layman 
yearn for the livelier manner of much recent historical writing.

TUNGSTEN A NOVEL BY CESAR VALLEJO; TRANSLATED BY ROBERT MEZEY; FOREWORD BY

By Edith Grossman, Grossman is a critic and translator of Latin American 
literature. She teaches at Dominican College in New York State, is the author 
of The Antipoetry of Nicanor Parra and recently translated Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera.

<TEXT>
<P>
Why read "Tungsten," a partisan novel written almost 60 years ago in which evil 
is unmitigated, virtue unblemished, and the characters seem to lack dimension 
or complexity as they play out their predetermined roles on the stage of the 
class struggle? Why read a book in which ideology reigns supreme, and why 
celebrate its first, belated translation into English? Because the author is 
Cesar Vallejo, one of the great poets of the 20th Century and a major figure in 
Latin American literature. 
</P>
<P>
Vallejo created a wrenching poetic language for Spanish that radically altered 
the shape of its imagery and the nature of its rhythms. No facile trend setter, 
Vallejo forged a new discourse in order to express his own visceral compassion 
for human suffering. He saw the world in piercing flashes of outrage and 
anguish, terror and pity, and what he saw wounded him like knife thrusts. A 
passionate, tragic poet, he mourned our loss of moral innocence and despaired 
of the injustice that moves the world. In the late 1920s, when he was living in 
Paris and eking out a meager livelihood as a journalist, the pain at the roots 
of his being found objective substantiation in radical politics. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the Peruvian Andes in 1892, he witnessed firsthand the victimization 
and exploitation of the South American Indians. Although his own family was not 
financially destitute (his father was a notary and minor bureaucrat in the 
small town of Santiago de Chuco), Vallejo was a cholo, a person born of mixed 
European and Indian ancestry. The fact is not irrelevant. In a society where 
social and economic status followed the color line with cosmic certainty, where 
racial discrimination was rigidly adhered to although rarely acknowledged in 
public, the representatives of foreign companies, with the wholehearted 
complicity of domestic colleagues, extracted high profits from the near-slavery 
of the illiterate, utterly alienated and ultimately helpless victims of that 
racism. Vallejo had ample opportunity to witness the brutalization en masse of 
the Indian underclass and the appalling greed of their lighter-skinned masters 
who carried on the colonial tradition of using Indians as forced labor in mines 
and on plantations. 
</P>
<P>
Twentieth-Century writers from Ciro Alegria to Manuel Scorza have denounced the 
Peruvian tragedy in their books. "Tungsten" was one of the earliest novels to 
do so in modern terms. As a young man, however, Vallejo's greatest energies 
were devoted to writing and publishing his poems ("Los heraldos negros," his 
first book, appeared in 1918); consequently, he remained on the periphery of 
the windstorms of political and social unrest that swept through South America 
in the second decade of the century, although he was in the time and place 
where growing agitation to establish justice for Peruvian Indians and workers 
began its inexorable march toward Marxism. 
</P>
<P>
Vallejo, Jose Carlos Mariategui (the "Shining Path" in today's Peru takes its 
name from his writings) and Victor Raul Haya de la Torre (a founder of the 
important APRA movement -- the "Popular Revolutionary American Alliance") 
crossed paths at the university in Trujillo. But Vallejo was an intermittent 
student. His family began to experience economic difficulties during his 
adolescence, and he was obliged to interrupt secondary school and then his 
university studies to take a series of jobs, which included office work in the 
mines at Tambores and Quiruvilca, and on a large sugar plantation in the 
Chicama Valley. 
</P>
<P>
These facts are not irrelevant either. They provided the historical raw 
material for "Tungsten," the documented background to Vallejo's outcry against 
the grim realities of Indian life in Peru. The shape that material would take 
-- his conviction that the problem of race was indistinguishable from the 
problem of class -- was determined by his increasingly active commitment to 
socialism, a political engagement that, by 1930, led to his expulsion from 
France, where he had gone to live seven years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The action of the novel is centered in a fictional mining town and its 
provincial capital, Colca. The time is 1917, just before the U.S. entry into 
World War I when a ready supply of tungsten would be crucial to the weapons 
industry. A North American corporation takes over the mine, and the boom is on: 
Peasants are first lured and then coerced into working for the company, local 
Indians, the Soras, are cheated of their land and animals, petit bourgeois 
entrepreneurs scramble on the backs of the poor for wealth and position, and 
venal officials and dignitaries find a new source of bribery and 
power-brokering in the foreign capitalists. The first two-thirds of the book, 
in fact, constitutes a genre study of unashamed thuggery, a series of vignettes 
of corruption, repression and brutality that sets the stage for the violent 
heart of "Tungsten" and the appearance of its proletarian Indian hero, Servando 
Huanca. 
</P>
<P>
Two Indian boys are forcibly conscripted into military service (the military as 
well as the mining contractors have "body quotas" -- numbers of recruits or 
workers that must be obtained by any means), and on the long march from their 
homes to Colca, when they are tied by the waist to the mules that their captors 
ride, they are so badly abused that one of them eventually dies. Outside the 
Subprefecture an angry crowd gathers, indignant at the visible signs of the 
conscripts' mistreatment. One defiant man, Servando Huanca, steps forward to 
speak for the crowd with natural authority and an instinctive class 
consciousness. These qualities inspire the people and momentarily cow the 
authorities, but then the troops are ordered to fire into the crowd, and later 
that night officially sanctioned vigilantes pursue any Indian they can find, 
shooting to kill. Some, however, are taken into custody, and deals are struck 
by sleazy officials which allow the prisoners to be sent off to a sure death in 
the mines to help fulfill the company's "body quota." 
</P>
<P>
Last and certainly least, the third section of the book is a kind of postscript 
to the Colca massacre. Vallejo allows his indignation and passion to turn into 
mechanical ideology: Servando Huanca "duckspeaks" a mercifully brief exercise 
in orthodoxy, proclaiming that world revolution is under way, that it will be 
led by a militant proletariat inspired by Lenin and not by bourgeois 
"intellectuals," that it will sweep away the ruling classes in Peru. Vallejo 
even permits the novel to end with this ponderously symbolic sentence: 
"Outside, the wind was rising, portending storm." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin J. O'Connor has written a thoughtful and informative foreword, Robert 
Mezey has done a fine job of translating Vallejo's often quirky Spanish, and 
both of them deserve our gratitude for their sensitivity and skill in bringing 
the work to the attention of an English-language audience. I am sorry that I 
cannot say as much for the editing. The typographical errors are frequent and 
unforgivable, and there is no indication as one reads that Mezey has provided 
important end notes to the text. This is a disservice to the reader; Vallejo 
and his translator deserve better.

Leo Estrada's suggested model of middle-class Mexican-Americans creating 
country clubs for ourselves so as to pass on our advantages to our young is 
probably unnecessary. Instead, the Latino professionals profiled in the article 
could directly benefit the next Mexican-American generation by teaching them 
their skills. For example, the Cal Poly Pomona campus (where I teach) boasts 
14% Latino students, and its School of Business Administration, with the 
largest number of declared majors on campus who are Latino and black, regularly 
hires practicing financial consultants and lawyers on a visiting, part-time 
basis. Although the money isn't great, sweet satisfactions can derive from 
having a Latino student earn the top grade on a corporate finance exam (as just 
happened to me) or from submitting a proposal to the National Science 
Foundation to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site where 
students may, under my guidance, undertake a yearlong study of attitudes and 
experiences of Latino MBAs in U.S. corporations.

What changes would you like to see in business practices and the workplace this 
year? How can business leaders and economic policy-makers improve the economy 
and the world in general in 1989? The Times ran these questions by people in 
various walks of life, and here are some of their answers: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Muriel Siebert, head of the Muriel Siebert &amp; Co. discount brokerage in New 
York, and first female member of the New York Stock Exchange: 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see certain business practices regulated. I think that the 
leveraged buyouts show the greed of people at their worst. . . . The LBOs are 
bypassing the purpose of the capital-raising system. I think that to the extent 
that people were stockholders in these companies . . . they should be allowed 
to continue to have some kind of share in the profits (after the leveraged 
buyouts) because these moves were done while they were stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
"Must greed be the creed? I would like to see that also rolled over to our 
defense contractors. I am pro defense. I believe in a strong country because 
people mistake gentility for weakness. If (contractors) cheat on defense 
contracts, I don't see why they don't go to jail. . . . I just feel that if you 
are a major defense contractor, you owe a fiduciary responsibility to this 
country because defense expenditures are putting a pretty big toll on the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Brimmer, former member of the Federal Reserve Board and head of a 
Washington economics consulting firm: 
</P>
<P>
"My leading wish is that the nation deal with the federal budget deficit. I 
would like to see a substantial reduction in 1989 and extending over the next 
three years. I would strongly recommend that we raise taxes. There should be 
some moderation in the level of government expenditures, but the real problem 
is the lag in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I also would like to see more done for education by business. The kind of 
education I'm talking about is at the elementary and secondary level. 
Businesses are already contributing to colleges. Businesses should do likewise 
for elementary and secondary schools. Business people can play a role as 
counselors and teachers. A firm might make available an engineer or 
mathematician to go into schools and teach. Business should do more to offer 
on-the-job training for unskilled, or limited-skills, people, perhaps through a 
(lower) learning wage. We would give business tax credits to do this." 
</P>
<P>
William R. Robertson, executive secretary of the Los Angeles County Federation 
of Labor, AFL-CIO: 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see a change in philosophy by the incoming President relating 
to labor relations and providing for fairness in our (labor) organizing efforts 
and contract negotiations. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I would also like to see some protection for workers losing their jobs because 
of mergers. It is a national disgrace. In too many mergers, the workers are the 
ones that suffer and the country as well. Something should be done to correct 
it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And, finally, this Administration should face reality in resolving the 
astronomical deficit." 
</P>
<P>
Steven D. Lydenberg, an associate with the "socially responsible" investment 
firm of Franklin Research &amp; Development: 
</P>
<P>
"There is an increasing interest around the country in social investing. People 
want to know not just the financial implications of making a commitment in a 
company, but also the social implication. That information is not very easy to 
come by. 
</P>
<P>
"So, if at the end of '89 corporations were disclosing in a uniform way their 
yield figures, their charitable contribution figures, the numbers of women and 
minorities in top management and board directors, their attitude on a number of 
comparable social issues, I would be very happy." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Borman, chairman of Patlex Corp. of Chatsworth, former astronaut and 
former chairman of Eastern Airlines: 
</P>
<P>
"We should begin to move toward taxing consumption -- a value-added tax. This 
is quite controversial as Al Ullman (Oregon Democrat and former chairman of the 
House Ways and Means Committee, who was defeated in 1988 after advocating a 
value-added tax) will tell you. But this taxing system is needed. It would 
certainly help our exports. Almost all of Europe is under the value-added 
taxing system. Also, it may encourage saving instead of consumption. One of the 
ways you discourage consumption is to tax it." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Harrington, co-chair of Democratic Socialists of America and author of 
"The Other America" and "The New American Poverty": 
</P>
<P>
"I hope Secretary of State Baker will build on the basic insights of former 
Treasury Secretary Baker (James Baker, former treasury secretary, was nominated 
by President-elect Bush to be Secretary of State) that a settlement of Third 
World debt is in the self-interest of America, opening up markets for business 
and labor. But then the new Baker will have to go far beyond the old, since 
Latin America now owes more than it did in 1982 when the crisis officially 
began, and several countries, including Argentina and Brazil, may see democracy 
subverted if current trends persist.

<P>
"At home, the nation must recognize that we can't waste young people, and 
particularly minorities and women, on illiteracy, unemployment and unproductive 
low-wage work. We must invest mightily in education, training and job 
generation." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Bromberg, a securities law expert and professor at Southern Methodist 
University: 
</P>
<P>
"There are several things I would like most to see changed in the economy and 
business practices. One, more concentration by business and government, both 
here and abroad, on . . . the facilitation of international trade and 
investment. This would require wider horizons for business people . . . and 
more effort by government to reduce and ultimately eliminate all kinds of 
restrictions on the movement of products. 
</P>
<P>
"Two, I would like to see a national consensus developed, preferably in the 
form of federal legislation, on corporate takeovers and buyouts that would 
recognize the efficiencies and benefits they bring as well as the dislocations 
and hardships they can cause. This would involve tax policies and labor polices 
and limitations on the ability of states to Balkanize corporate law by 
different anti-takeover statutes everywhere. (There also should be) some kind 
of limitation on management self-entrenchment and self-enrichment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we could use a lot of clarification of the securities laws. I think 
the courts have done a good job of saying what insider trading is. The kind of 
issues that are most difficult are what really is parking (of stock)? How much 
cooperation or similar action by different individuals or different groups of 
individuals makes it collaboration? These issues haven't been well resolved. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bahouth, executive director of Greenpeace in Washington: 
</P>
<P>
"People now view threats to human security less in terms of political threats 
and more in environmental and economic terms. So for my wish list, I would ask 
first that we deal with the issue of the greenhouse effect. We better develop 
some alternative views in mass transportation and cut subsidies to reflect the 
true cost of fossil fuels in terms of pollution, along with the actual economic 
cost of development. Then, we could put more money into research and 
development of wind and solar energy. 
</P>
<P>
"(Also on my wish list is) peace on earth. If we want peace on earth, we have 
to start looking seriously at the fact that we are making more and more 
weapons, and in a process which endangers the health of American people. . . . 
Production plants have been proven to have released into the air and water 
radioactivity and toxic chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
"Also, it would be nice if we could learn that the rain forest affects all of 
us. We need to preserve it. And we would like the tuna industry to stop killing 
dolphins."

KEEPING PETRODOLLARS AT HOME; 
</P>
<P>
SAUDIS MAKING EFFORT TO BOOST REGIONAL TOURISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DONNA FENN HEINTZEN, Associated Press 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Saudis, fewer petrodollars in their pockets and worried about security and 
culture shock, have started looking for holidays at home and finding that there 
is more to the country than sand. 
</P>
<P>
In the oil price heyday of the 1970s, Saudi Muslims flocked to the kingdom's 
air terminals to escape the heat and monotony of the desert for the great 
tourist capitals -- Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles, the French and 
Spanish Rivieras, Istanbul and Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
But local tourism has been on the rise for the last five years, spearheaded by 
a government campaign to encourage Saudis to spend their vacation dollars at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"There are quite a lot of religiously conservative families who suffer when 
they go abroad," said Ibrahim al Sayed, director general of tourism development 
in the country's mountainous southwest Asir region. "They don't want their 
teen-agers to copy Westerners." 
</P>
<P>
He added that many Saudis are also acutely aware that language and cultural 
barriers make them attractive victims for con artists abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"I've traveled in Europe and I've faced some of the troubles," said Fahd al 
Sayejh, public relations manager at the Riyadh Intercontinental Hotel. "My 
family's now looking for a villa in Abha (in the cooler Asir region). There are 
many people who spend their summers there who used to go to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beautiful. It reminds us of the old days when we used to go to Lebanon 
every summer. The mountains are the same," he added. "(But) in the oil boom 
years, businessmen thought nothing of driving to the airport and boarding any 
available international flight. Now people are more aware of spending their 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Tourism within Saudi Arabia may seem like a hard sell, given the country's 
reputation as a "desert kingdom," lacking much in the way of amusement. 
</P>
<P>
But beaches along the country's eastern border on the Persian Gulf draw big 
crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Jidda on the Red Sea attracts scuba-diving enthusiasts and Najran, close to 
Yemen, offers unusual architecture. For a change of scenery, many tourists try 
the southwest. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole southwest area is very popular," said Antoni Kuhnen, who runs the 
Al-Baha Motel in that region. Kuhnen estimates that the motel, opened in 1985, 
now books around 20,000 tourists a year. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Baha, Saudi Arabia's smallest province, is situated between Taif, where the 
government retreats into the mountains for the summer months, and Abha, capital 
of Asir province, which boasts 1,736 square miles of national park. 
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper noted that "visitors to the Abha region reached an 
unprecedented number, to the extent that the real estate offices in Abha cannot 
cope with the great demand for furnished and unfurnished flats." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 800,000 visitors were reported to have made it despite a 
relatively small airport. 
</P>
<P>
The recent popularity of in-country tourism is due largely to the government. 
Five years ago, the few tourists who came to this region had to either camp out 
or rely on the kindness of strangers for accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there are five hotels in the area, some of them bankrolled by the Finance 
Ministry. Private businessmen are also being encouraged to invest in tourism. 
</P>
<P>
An amusement park would make the area more attractive to Saudi families who 
generally have large numbers of children to entertain, he said. Land has 
already been allocated, but awaits an investor. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Baha does not lack scenic beauty. At nearly 10,000 feet above sea level, the 
air is cool, crisp, and a bit damp -- a welcome change from just about anyplace 
else in the kingdom during the summer months. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains, rough, craggy, and dotted with scrubby green plants, rise 
dramatically out of the Tihama Valley and are populated by shepherds tending 
flocks of sheep and goats. Baboons lope down the mountainside, carrying scraps 
of food fed to them by motel staff and early rising guests. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the facilities are there, the tourists will come," said Kuhnen, who 
nonetheless believes the region suffers for lack of recreational diversions.

AT $80 PER MUSHROOM, PRICE FOR MATSUTAKE IS HIGH EVEN FOR THE JAPANESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the land of $7 apples and $6 boxes of granola, matsutake mushrooms are in a 
class of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese drop their usual tones of careful politeness and become positively 
rapturous in describing these unassuming brown fungi, their woodsy taste and 
piney smell. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of one of the world's most exclusive restaurants, Kicho, where meals 
can run $800 a person and only an introduction from a previous customer can win 
a reservation, recently wrote: "In autumn we can almost not do our business 
without matsutake." 
</P>
<P>
But for the uninitiated, it is the price tag of the matsutake, or pine-tree 
mushrooms, that is so breathtaking: a few inches high and, in fact, rather 
mushroom-like in appearance, a single well-shaped matsutake can cost as much as 
$80; even an average one will run $40 per stem. 
</P>
<P>
Matsutake are so pricey and so prized that matsutake fraud has now entered the 
Japanese lexicon. Recently it was discovered that some of these mushrooms were 
being sold with tiny lead slivers inserted in their stems to inflate their 
weight and thus their asking price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worth It to Japanese 
</P>
<P>
For the Japanese, who adore all manner of mushrooms and use about half a dozen 
different varieties in their everyday food, the price is clearly worth it. "I 
love them," a Japanese newspaper editor said recently, as he dropped the 
subject at hand -- stock market manipulation -- to wax eloquent about 
matsutake. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese folk saying sums up the emotionalism toward matsutake: "The mountain 
where you picked matsutake cannot be forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
With this saying in mind, a farming community troubled by a high rate of 
bachelorhood among its young men recently held a matsutake-picking party in an 
effort to entice women back to the farm. 
</P>
<P>
According to mushroom connoisseurs, matsutake are expensive because their 
season is short -- just a few weeks in late fall -- and because they can grow 
only in the wild. Japan's wilderness has been disappearing steadily in the face 
of relentless urbanization, and the red pine trees around which matsutake 
flourish have also been diminishing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Domesticated Yet 
</P>
<P>
The finest scientists have failed so far to domesticate the matsutake on a mass 
scale, despite repeated efforts. Mie Ogoshi of Japan's Tsuji Cooking School 
said that matsutake were much more common and much cheaper 20 years ago and 
were used liberally in the kitchen. Now, however, they are rationed 
parsimoniously: paper-thin slices in a special broth, a few bits mixed in a 
rice dish or a few grilled with a touch of lime and soy sauce. One special soup 
features a little matsutake with a touch of real gold shavings. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for matsutake is so strong that the import-resistant Japanese have 
turned to South Korea and China, where matsutake also grow and cost much less. 
</P>
<P>
Mushroom aficionados insist that these imports do not taste as good as local 
ones; among other drawbacks, to satisfy customs inspectors the matsutake must 
be washed well, which attenuates their aroma, they say. Nonetheless, every 
fall, die-hard matsutake lovers figure that it is worth the price of a 
Tokyo-Seoul round-trip ticket (about $500) to fill a few boxes with fresh 
Korean matsutake and lovingly carry them home. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even in affluent Japan, there are many who find $80 per mushroom a bit 
rich for the blood. One Japanese woman who raved about the taste and autumnal 
smell of matsutake admitted, after calming down, that she had not bought one in 
15 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like They Are Gold' 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the price tag on the matsutake, it is like they are gold," 
acknowledged Ogoshi, of the cooking school. And like many high-priced foods in 
Japan, including the beautiful cantaloupe grown here and sold, individually 
wrapped, for $80 or more, matsutake most often are given as presents. 
</P>
<P>
For those who love their matsutake but cannot afford them, one enterprising 
Japanese company recently developed "essence of matsutake," a small vial of 
which costs only $2.50. The liquid can be poured on top of the lowly shiitake 
or ma-shu-ru-mu (white American-style mushroom), allowing the diner to imagine 
it is the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
For the truly desperate, stores sell a few slices of matsutake for the 
comparatively reasonable price of $20. When sniffed very closely they do give 
off a piney odor. Cooked -- one minute in a hot broiler or over a fire, with 
drop of a little lime juice -- they taste, well, like a mushroom.

FROM CUCUMBERS TO CAVIAR; 
</P>
<P>
DEPARTMENT STORE EATERIES HAVE GONE TRENDY TO ATTRACT BUSY SHOPPERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When caterer David Zafferelli joined the throngs at Nordstrom's new downtown 
San Francisco store in October, he dropped $150 on two flannel shirts and 
another $150 for bubbly and Beluga caviar at the store's Champagne Exchange 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
"We just thought that was as much fun as shopping," he said. "I'll always go 
for any excuse to drink champagne and eat caviar." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, shoppers who stop to nosh at department stores are finding chic, 
newfangled eateries in place of the proper tearooms and restaurants of their 
childhoods. Whereas patrons in the early part of the century sipped tea and 
nibbled cucumber sandwiches, customers of upscale department stores today are 
more likely to have espresso and cookies or Cornish game hen and Chardonnay or 
mesquite-grilled chicken and pasta salad. 
</P>
<P>
The shifts in department store food service reflect a fundamental change in the 
philosophy of shoppers, observers say. In the old days, people would make 
shopping an all-day event, with a leisurely lunch or tea break built in. Today, 
with time-starved but hard-working baby boomers hankering for service and 
quality, the right restaurant can serve not only as a lure but also as an 
incentive to linger in the store. And shoppers such as Zafferelli have proved 
willing to spend liberally for the ambiance. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, old-fashioned tearooms still exist, and some, such as those at 
Bullocks Wilshire and Bullock's Pasadena, are thriving, particularly at holiday 
time. But many stores in recent years have turned these genteel anachronisms 
into stylish cafes or bistros where customers come year-round just to dine, 
never mind the shopping. 
</P>
<P>
"The '80s has brought us into a whole different era," said Robert J. Nyman, 
president of George Lang Corp., a New York firm that develops restaurant 
concepts. "Most stores today are using food service as an amenity that has to 
do with the total marketing of the store." 
</P>
<P>
With department stores undergoing sweeping changes of late, many retailers, 
particularly downtown merchants that must compete with ubiquitous suburban 
malls, have strived to hold onto or devise unique operations that make them a 
destination. Restaurants often fill the bill, even if they don't contribute 
heartily to the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
At the new Nordstrom in San Francisco, for example, the marble-topped champagne 
bar has become a draw for upscale customers, as has an authentic English pub 
modeled on one at Harrods in London. At the flagship Bloomingdale's in 
Manhattan, the premier dining spot among half a dozen eateries is Le Train 
Bleu, a re-creation of a luxury Orient Express-type dining car. The Dayton 
Hudson department stores in the Midwest are expanding a Marketplace Foods 
concept that offers carry-out pasta, stir-fried dishes, freshly baked breads 
and frozen yogurt to busy downtown workers. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike their tearoom predecessors, which usually were situated in a store's 
highest reaches, these food outlets are often stashed next to fashion 
departments. And they are a far cry from the Formica-topped counters prevalent 
at five-and-dime and discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunities for food in department stores are the best they've been in 
over 20 years," said John D. Lovelace, central director of food services for 
Dayton Hudson in Minneapolis. "People eat every day, but they don't shop every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Food service has gone in and out of favor with retailers over the last few 
decades, and even today retailers' philosophies differ widely. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very mixed bag," said Charles J. Leven, senior vice president, 
director of operations at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York. "Some companies are 
cutting back, a few are expanding." Saks intends to open its first restaurant 
at the flagship Manhattan store next year, Leven said, after customers clamored 
for food service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Quick Food' Concepts 
</P>
<P>
Until about 1950, large department stores catering to the carriage trade 
typically used a chunk of their space for tearooms. In the 1960s, the 
popularity of such rooms declined, and many started losing money. As real 
estate became more valuable in the 1970s, merchants began devoting the space to 
clothing and other items that were more profitable. At the same time, many 
stores were going into suburban malls that had abundant sit-down restaurants or 
fast-food outlets in so-called food courts. 
</P>
<P>
Then women went to work in record numbers and the population became more health 
and diet conscious. Fewer people had the time or inclination to spend a 
leisurely afternoon at their favorite tearoom. That gave rise to a variety of 
"quick food" concepts in stores catering to customers for whom money was less 
of an object than convenience and quality. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom plunged into the food business 10 years ago after having leased space 
for years to a small chain of restaurants. It now has 70 food outlets in 58 
stores, most under the names Espresso Bar and Cafe Express, featuring fresh 
soups and salads. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with having to attract shoppers to a seedy location three blocks from 
Union Square in San Francisco, Nordstrom decided to go in for some culinary 
theatrics in its newest store. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to create little pockets of fun," said Jim Dickinson, general 
manager of the Seattle-based chain's restaurant division. "We also wanted to 
create a reason for people to stay in our stores rather than get out to our 
competitors." 
</P>
<P>
The Pub, strategically placed next to the men's department, is modeled on the 
Green Man at Harrods in London, an innovative retailer that houses about 20 
food outlets and a massive food hall where Londoners and tourists alike buy 
pricey groceries. The Nordstrom room features stools covered with forest green 
leather, a plank floor made of Kentucky barn wood, a healthy selection of 
imported and domestic beers and television monitors. 
</P>
<P>
If the Pub idea proves successful, Dickinson said, Nordstrom plans to expand it 
into other new stores nationwide. The chain also is considering a "bread basket 
concept" that would sell freshly baked goods and small open-face sandwiches, 
already dubbed Nordwiches. 
</P>
<P>
The store's Champagne Exchange was designed to offer a high return. It takes up 
less space by far than would a traditional tearoom yet affords a high markup on 
its caviar and 103 champagne varieties. The concept "enables the customer to 
spend a lot of money," Dickinson said. "We do find, particularly in San 
Francisco, it doesn't bother people to be drinking a $9 glass of champagne." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lots of Flash 
</P>
<P>
The chain also this holiday rolled out its Nordstrom Select Pantry, a selection 
of gift food items developed in its restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Dickinson said, Nordstrom's restaurant operations account for 1.5% of 
the chain's annual sales (which last year totaled nearly $2 billion) yet 22% of 
its transactions, indicating that food tabs are generally far lower than those 
for other purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Bloomingdale's flagship store in New York also goes in for selling sizzle along 
with its steaks. "The restaurants at Bloomingdale's have evolved into unique 
concepts in tune with the eating public," said Will Hellemeyer, director of 
food service. "We are what people expect of restaurants in the '80s . . . and 
not what they expect to find in a department store restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
After renovating the housewares department several years ago, the store was 
left with a long, narrow space on an intermediate level between two floors. A 
store designer came up with the idea of copying a luxury dining car, complete 
with green velvet chairs, white linen tablecloths and brass chandeliers. 
</P>
<P>
Le Train Bleu (named for a midnight blue engine), which opened in 1978, is "a 
Continental restaurant that competes with restaurants on the East Side of 
Manhattan and is rated in dining guides," Hellemeyer said. With seating for 64, 
the restaurant features such specialties as calf's liver with cassis and 
shallots, grilled Cornish game hen stuffed with foie gras and wild rice and 
grilled swordfish with sun-dried tomato butter. Average tab: $20. 
</P>
<P>
Among other Bloomie's food service operations, Hellemeyer said, are Forty 
Carrots, a "healthy food" restaurant in which the store years ago introduced 
frozen yogurt to the New York market; Showtime Cafe, an upscale cafeteria 
similar to Cafe Casino, and Espresso Bar, "a Euro-chic Italian cafe" offering 
desserts, fresh pastas, salads and wines. 
</P>
<P>
The decision whether to offer food service is usually based on a store's 
location and bottom line. Store officials would not talk about their 
restaurants' financial results, but they acknowledged that food service is an 
expensive proposition. 
</P>
<P>
The food business "in general has lower margins than most other merchandise in 
a department store," said Ken Stevens, a consultant with the Los Angeles office 
of McKinsey &amp; Co. It comes down to a trade-off, with the retailer 
determining whether the intangible benefits of offering the service outweigh 
the reduced profitability. 
</P>
<P>
At Marshall Field's in Chicago, for instance, the legendary Walnut Room -- a 
restaurant in the old tradition -- is not considered a big profit maker "other 
than that it's a big draw," said Homer G. Sharp, head of central display. 
"Obviously, people go shopping while they're here."

<P>
Some End Food Service 
</P>
<P>
With a typical sit-down eatery costing between $500,000 and $1 million to 
install, many retailers, May Co. California among them, are inclined to put 
restaurants into free-standing stores but not into those mall locations served 
by a food court. Another consideration is space: New department stores tend to 
be far smaller than the huge stores of years past and have less space to spare 
for low-return businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Bonwit Teller, a fashion specialty store, has phased out its food business. 
Until its purchase by May Department Stores two years ago, Robinson's was 
making a big push into food service. Now, it has only three food outlets 
chain-wide, all of them leased. 
</P>
<P>
In designing its newest stores, including those in Los Angeles and Palm Desert, 
Bullock's left out restaurants. And when the chain remodeled its Santa Ana 
location, the restaurant was removed. 
</P>
<P>
The tearoom in Bullock's Pasadena, according to James B. Brooks, the store's 
general manager, is the chain's most profitable food service operation and 
lately has been expanding its successful banquet business. Even so, the tearoom 
recently eliminated its evening food service, primarily because of increased 
restaurant competition in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest proponents of food is Dayton Hudson Department Store Co., 
which claims to have the largest upscale food service among U.S. department 
stores, serving 12 million patrons a year. 
</P>
<P>
When Lovelace, the food service director, joined the company in 1982, he 
immediately set about developing new "upscale fast-food" concepts and 
transforming the company's traditional sit-down restaurants "to meet the needs 
of the customer of the '80s." 
</P>
<P>
Among other operations, the company came up with Yogurt Express, which 
generates a hefty $1,000 in sales per square foot (compared to about $200 for 
non-food merchandise) and is being rolled out to several of the company's 37 
stores; 700 Express, designed to serve customers quality fast food within 10 
minutes, and a combination of five quick food concepts that replaced the 
flagship Minneapolis store's traditional Sky Room and quickly tripled sales. 
The company is also expanding its 4-year-old Marketplace Foods, similar to 
Macy's Cellar in New York, with a substantial carry-out area. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting customers' rapidly changing palates, ethnic foods are playing a 
bigger role in Dayton Hudson's offerings. Forget the cling peach halves, 
cottage cheese and iceberg lettuce leaves of yore. New menus offer Morocco 
salad, made with boneless chicken breast and couscous ($6), and smoked salmon 
with radicchio, bibb lettuce, avocado, grapefruit, chopped egg and caviar, 
Dayton Hudson's most expensive salad at $7. 
</P>
<P>
The Broadway, too, has found that its customers' changing tastes have forced it 
to adapt quickly to new trends. It recently closed a traditional sit-down 
restaurant at its Brea Mall store in favor of a deli service with lighter fare. 
"We . . . have seen a really remarkable response," said Richard F. Clayton, 
president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Food Is Fashion' 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Bullock's, the Broadway has put food service operations into its newest 
stores, but it also recently closed restaurants in Beverly Center and Baldwin 
Hills where it "couldn't come up with a formula that worked," Clayton said. The 
43-store chain now operates 24 food facilities, serving more than 2 million 
diners a year. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a lot of transactions," Clayton said. "It's important because we touch 
a lot of customers." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, food service, once the province of large department stores, has also 
spread to smaller specialty apparel boutiques such as Koala Blue, with its 
Australian-style milk bars; Fred Segal, which has restaurants at stores in 
Santa Monica and on Melrose Avenue; Merry Go Round, a chain selling young men's 
and women's apparel that is testing a '50s-style diner and soda fountain in a 
store in Denver, and Barneys, an exclusive women's clothier in Manhattan that 
has Le Cafe, a buffet and bistro bar with about 90 seats. 
</P>
<P>
To Dickinson of Nordstrom, the merging of menus and merchandise makes sense. 
"We consider ourselves a fashion retail store, and we believe food is fashion," 
he said. "There is tremendous opportunity for good dining."

<P>
Dick Haddon's church has an identity problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell people that the First United Methodist Church of Gardena is not in 
Gardena," the Rev. Haddon said, "and people just kind of stare in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Gardena, but it's not. Even the post office says 'Gardena,' but the 
reality is, we do not live in Gardena. . . . If we had a fire . . . the 
response would come from the city of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
That is a complicated fact of life in Harbor Gateway, the 8-mile long, 
4-block-wide umbilical cord acquired at the turn of the century to link Los 
Angeles to its port. 
</P>
<P>
In a city where community names conjure up images -- Venice, Silver Lake, Boyle 
Heights -- Harbor Gateway draws a blank. 
</P>
<P>
Bounded on the west by Gardena and Torrance and on the east by Carson and 
unincorporated county land, the area was for decades known as the "city strip," 
the "shoestring strip" or, simply, "the strip." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Area Rechristened 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the Los Angeles City Council rechristened the area to try to 
bring a sense of identity and community pride to its citizens -- some of whom 
do not even know they live in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Gateway lacks much of what makes a community a community -- no central 
business district, no civic center or gathering place, no library branch, no 
police station and, as Haddon noted, no post office. Its largest park is a 
cemetery. And, despite the new name, mailing addresses of residents remain 
unchanged. They still say Torrance or Gardena, not Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, this leaves some people confused. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'Look, my mailing address is Gardena,' " reported Gene Painter, the 
city of Gardena's superintendent of human services who said he does not turn 
away Harbor Gateway residents who ask for help. "Strange as it may seem, they 
don't know where they live." 
</P>
<P>
Optician Chris Toughill joined the Torrance Chamber of Commerce when he opened 
his shop in a Harbor Gateway strip mall, and his neighbors did the same. It 
wasn't until the Torrance mayor declined to attend their grand opening, 
Toughill said, that the merchants discovered that they were in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Even the young toughs of the Gardena 13 gang, interviewed while hanging out on 
a Harbor Gateway street corner, insisted they were standing in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
In population, Harbor Gateway is tied with Westwood as Los Angeles' 
second-fastest growing area. Sylmar is first. Between 1980 and 1986, according 
to Los Angeles Planning Department estimates, Harbor Gateway's population 
increased 15.6%, from 30,238 to 34,951. 
</P>
<P>
A drive through the Gateway is like a trip from the city to the suburbs. On the 
north end, which begins at El Segundo Boulevard, there are apartments needing 
repair, gang graffiti on walls and single-family homes with barred windows. The 
southern end -- which stops at Sepulveda Boulevard, where Harbor City begins -- 
is punctuated by newly built strip malls, condominiums and well-manicured 
lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Property values follow a similar pattern, with the lowest prices in the north. 
Home values in nearby Torrance or Gardena, however, are considerably higher. 
Real estate agents report that a house in Harbor Gateway might sell for as much 
as $50,000 less than one across the street in another community. 
</P>
<P>
Agents attribute the difference to better city services, particularly in 
Torrance, which has its own schools. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute you mention Los Angeles," said Gardena real estate agent John 
Warner, "it frightens . . . people away. It's just one of those things. Homes 
have always been cheaper over there (Harbor Gateway)." 
</P>
<P>
Said resident Betty Roy: "I hate to be known to live in the strip. When my 
friends ask where I live, I tell them Torrance." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, four years after the name change -- in spite of spiffy blue-and-white 
signs that declare "Harbor Gateway" below the Los Angeles city seal -- those 
who live and work there say they still feel betwixt and between, not fully a 
part of Los Angeles, Harbor Gateway or the bordering cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'In Limbo' 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they complain that their new moniker has not brought with it what 
they really want: more attention from city officials, better services such as 
street cleaning and tree trimming and, above all, increased police protection. 
</P>
<P>
"We're like in limbo," said Roy, a longtime resident of the Gateway's southern 
end. "We're not really Torrance and we're not really Carson. . . . We're only 
here because Los Angeles needs this little piece of land to attach to the 
harbor. Nobody cares about us. . . . We're like the forgotten people." 
</P>
<P>
For Sylvia Figueroa, life on the border means a daily struggle at It's a 
Miracle, the Mexican pizza parlor she opened a year ago at Gardena Boulevard 
and Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Gardena is across the street, and the differences are stark. On the 
Gardena side, Gardena Boulevard -- that city's main business thoroughfare -- is 
getting a face lift. The street is clean, and the trees are neatly trimmed. 
City officials are offering grants to business owners for renovations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood Contrasts 
</P>
<P>
Across the street in Los Angeles, the trees are scraggly and overgrown, 
vagrants sleep in a littered vacant lot, liquor stores abound and the Gardena 
13 gang seems to own the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"The other side there's no drunk people, no people looking for drugs," said 
Figueroa, who sweeps her sidewalk regularly. "The other side is so clean. Even 
the sidewalk is clean. 
</P>
<P>
"You see the street?" she asked, pointing to a pile of litter. "That's 
terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who represents the area, 
conceded that the Gateway is not getting its share of services. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to get a library in there, because no matter where you put a 
library in the Gateway, you only serve a limited number of city residents," she 
said. "It's difficult to get a street cleaning service on a regular basis 
because they have to come from somewhere else to get there. . . . It's not like 
having a nice, round community where you have something in the middle and it 
serves everybody around it." 
</P>
<P>
The United Way apparently agrees. In March, the umbrella agency's 
Harbor/Southeast division declared Harbor Gateway an "under-served geographic 
area," citing "real gaps in law enforcement" and social services. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration is part of a long-term plan by the United Way to upgrade Harbor 
Gateway by organizing neighborhood leaders to form nonprofit programs for 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
A citizens group, chaired by Haddon, is setting goals for the project, 
apparently marking the first time that community leaders around the Gateway 
have come together to talk about the area's problems. The minister and some 
others agree that the first goal should be improving community pride and 
cohesiveness to create political clout. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, residents must reverse 82 years of history. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, since the so-called Shoestring Strip Annexation of Dec. 26, 
1906, Harbor Gateway residents have somehow coalesced into five distinct 
neighborhoods. From north to south, their rough boundaries are El Segundo 
Boulevard to Rosecrans Avenue; Rosecrans to Redondo Beach Boulevard; Redondo 
Beach to Artesia Boulevard; Artesia to 190th Street; and 190th Street to 
Sepulveda Boulevard. The east-west boundaries of the three northern 
neighborhoods are Vermont Avenue and Figueroa Street, while Western and 
Normandie avenues bound the two in the south. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Harbor Gateway is a racially mixed, middle-income area, with an 
estimated median household income of $30,431 and a population that is 48.4% 
white, 13.2% black, 16.5% Asian and 21.8% other racial groups, according to the 
1980 census, the most recent statistics available. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos -- whose numbers are not tallied as part of the racial breakdown in the 
1980 census -- are Harbor Gateway's largest minority group, accounting for 
32.9% of the overall population, according to census data. 
</P>
<P>
However, the picture changes when the area is more closely examined. 
Demographic statistics show that the various Gateway neighborhoods often 
resemble adjacent communities more closely than they do one another. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the two Gateway neighborhoods near south South-Central Los Angeles 
and Compton have the heaviest concentration of blacks, 44.7%. Whites make up 
23.6% of those two neighborhoods, which extend north from Redondo Beach 
Boulevard, and Asians make up 6.9%. The estimated median household income there 
is $27,453. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Make-Up of Community 
</P>
<P>
But in the strip's midsection, from Artesia Boulevard to 190th Street, the 
population reflects that of the southern end of Gardena, which is heavily 
Asian. There, the black population is minuscule -- just 0.4% -- with most of 
the population split between whites, 48.1%, and Asians, 44.8%. Estimated 
household income in this section jumps dramatically, to $44,498. 
</P>
<P>
And south of 190th Street, approaching predominantly white Torrance, the white 
population jumps even higher, to 66.3%, while the Asian population dips to 8.6% 
and the number of blacks rises slightly, to 2%. Median household income is 
$27,607. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is primarily residential, the Gateway also includes a burgeoning 
business district at the San Diego and Harbor freeways, where, according to the 
California Department of Transportation, 500,000 cars drive by each day, making 
it the second-busiest intersection in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called 190th Street Corridor is a major drawing card for commercial 
developers, who have built about 5 million square feet of office space there in 
the last eight years. Gleaming high-rises with pleasant landscaping have 
replaced a Shell oil refinery and manufacturing plants. 
</P>
<P>
"We sort of had a shift from the Industrial Age to the Information Age," said 
Howard Mann, president of Andrex Development Co., one of the area's major 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
Mann predicts that the move away from industrial to commercial uses will help 
upgrade nearby areas by attracting home buyers who hold high-paying jobs in 
what he calls Harbor Gateway's "urban cluster." Already, he is planning a 
restaurant to meet that market, based on an analysis that, he said, "found that 
the average income per household within a 5-mile radius of this intersection is 
$50,000." 
</P>
<P>
Dining in elegance, however, is certainly not a priority farther north in 
Harbor Gateway, where large concentrations of undocumented Latinos residents 
are struggling to get by. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the United Way found that illegal Latino immigrants are the "most 
under-served" group in the Gateway. 
</P>
<P>
Haddon and other local leaders said their presence also makes it difficult to 
form neighborhood coalitions because illegal aliens fear they will attract 
unwanted attention from immigration authorities if they participate in 
community affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Their need is to be invisible," the minister said, "and that does not make for 
a good community." 
</P>
<P>
Haddon is particularly attuned to the problems of undocumented residents 
because his church runs the 3-year-old Harbor Gateway Center, one of only two 
social service agencies the United Way found serving the strip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Center's Problems 
</P>
<P>
The center -- which offers a variety of nutritional, health and educational 
programs to about 1,500 people -- lacks money and staff. The executive director 
left more than a year ago when the money to pay her ran out. Haddon, who took 
the pastor's job in July, has been doing her job ever since. 
</P>
<P>
United Way officials say they would like to strengthen the center and also 
persuade social service agencies in neighboring communities to expand 
operations here. Their study showed that the area lacks adequate shelters for 
battered women, delinquency prevention programs, drug- and alcohol-abuse 
programs and crisis intervention centers. 
</P>
<P>
If there is one common thread in the complaints from Gateway residents, it is 
the increasing gang activity and the lack of police protection. Many said that 
they go for days without seeing a patrol car and that officers covering the 
area are often sent on calls elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police officials said they have been trying to improve service, 
especially during the past year when citizens groups and Flores have pressed 
for additional patrols. But they also acknowledged that cars are called out of 
the area more often than they would like. Capt. Sandy Wasson of the Los Angeles 
Police Department's Southeast Division, which covers the part of the strip 
north of the San Diego Freeway, took issue with residents who say Harbor 
Gateway gets less than its fair share of coverage. He said a recent deployment 
study showed that while the area has fewer patrol cars -- just one basic car in 
the north and one in the south -- it also has less crime. 
</P>
<P>
Wasson said he views Harbor Gateway as "a neighborhood in transition that's got 
great potential." He has encouraged the formation of neighborhood watch groups. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, for one, said she senses a growing participation in such groups and "a 
renewed interest in community improvement." 
</P>
<P>
She maintained that the city has improved services in recent years, especially 
police coverage. She also noted that a Harbor Gateway paramedic unit was 
established in June and that this year, the city Library Department finally 
included a proposal for a Harbor Gateway branch in its long-term plan. 
</P>
<P>
The councilwoman said she would like the Gateway to have its own post office 
and ZIP code. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important," she said, "to have an actual tag and title on who you 
are and where you are." 
</P>
<P>
But she said she knows persuading the federal government will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Flores said, she is thankful for whatever recognition the new 
name has brought the area. 
</P>
<P>
"At least," she said, "I know that when I mention Harbor Gateway in City 
Council now, my colleagues know what I'm talking about."

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the time, Republican presidential contender Ronald Reagan called it "a 
shabby, needless blow." His intra-party rival, George Bush, branded it "an 
abject American retreat." And then-Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.) termed it 
"unconscionable." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such criticism, 10 years ago today, on Jan. 1, 1979, the Jimmy Carter 
Administration broke formal U.S. ties with Taiwan and established diplomatic 
relations with the People's Republic of China. 
</P>
<P>
"We are recognizing a simple reality," President Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
But, as a matter of American foreign policy, it had been anything but simple. 
For nearly three decades, the United States had refused to recognize the 
Communist regime in Beijing and had pretended that the Chinese Nationalists on 
Taiwan were the government for all of China. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 10 years later, the entire relationship between the United States and 
China has changed. New assumptions govern the behavior of both nations, and 
U.S. scholars predict that in the next few years the two governments may find 
themselves in increasing conflict with one another on a number of foreign 
policy questions, such as the Middle East and Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that China and the United States won't be as close as they were 
before," said Thomas W. Robinson of the American Enterprise Institute. "There 
has to be a certain distancing on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, during the last decade the U.S. recognition of Beijing -- and 
its avoidance of official dealings with Taiwan -- has become an established, 
accepted fact in American domestic politics. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan, once one of Taiwan's closest friends in American politics, 
honored the U.S. recognition of Beijing last month by saying he is confident 
that the United States and China will "forge even stronger ties and build a 
safer, more prosperous world." Taiwan, meanwhile, has managed to survive and 
prosper despite its diplomatic isolation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Longer in Tandem 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the United States and China no longer operate in close 
tandem with one another in international affairs in the way that they did a 
decade ago. The common bond of shared opposition to the Soviet Union has frayed 
as the United States and China separately seek warmer ties with the government 
of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an increasing sense that the era in which the bilateral relationship 
(between the United States and China) was based importantly on opposition to 
Moscow has ended," University of Washington Prof. Nicholas R. Lardy wrote 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
During the last two years the United States and China have been at odds over a 
number of issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chinese Arms Sales an Issue 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials voiced bitter complaints about China's arms sales to the Middle 
East, including the sale of Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran and 
intermediate-range ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia. China took umbrage at 
U.S. congressional resolutions denouncing China's policies on human rights and 
in Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
As if to symbolize the current atmosphere of mistrust, China recently imposed 
new travel restrictions on American diplomats working at consulates in the 
Chinese cities of Shenyang and Shanghai. The United States called these curbs 
"unreasonable" and countered by slapping new limits on personnel at the Chinese 
Consulate in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of reciprocal nastiness would have been unthinkable 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the first place, the United States and China did not even have any diplomats 
living and working in the heartland of each other's territory. Second, both 
nations were eager to set aside all sources of conflict at the time to work 
together against the perceived Soviet threat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wanted Strategic Partner 
</P>
<P>
"The United States didn't have too much choice," said one West European 
diplomat who follows Chinese affairs. "China was looking for a strategic 
partner against the Soviet Union. It found two countries who were willing to 
play the game: Japan and the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Although President Richard M. Nixon had moved to normalize ties with Beijing 
during his historic 1972 visit to China, neither he nor his successor, 
President Gerald R. Ford, was able to establish diplomatic relations with the 
Communist regime. They were never able to overcome the strong support for 
Taiwan's Nationalist regime in the right wing of the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, for example, the time then-Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) resorted to 
strong-arm tactics against Ford and Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
One day in May, 1976, Goldwater sent a private ultimatum to the Ford White 
House. He said he had heard a radio report that the Ford Administration was 
planning to establish diplomatic relations with "Red China," either before or 
after the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Intend to Stay Quiet' 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make any sense to me to forgo our friends on Taiwan and I don't 
intend to stay quiet about it, so please within 24 hours let me know what the 
truth is, and I mean the truth," Goldwater wrote. He threatened to withdraw 
political support for Ford, who was then being challenged by Reagan for the 
Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
According to files at the Gerald R. Ford presidential library, Ford and 
Kissinger were forced to cave in. Within a day, Kissinger called Goldwater and 
gave him the assurances that were necessary to avoid a public dispute. 
</P>
<P>
It was left to Carter, a Democratic President, to take the political heat of 
recognizing China, and he, too, delayed doing so until soon after the 1978 
congressional elections. When Carter finally made the public announcement, on 
Dec. 15, 1978, he was immediately savaged by conservative Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Within a month, Reagan was not only criticizing Carter's recognition of 
Beijing, but also advocating "continuation of government-to-government 
relations between the United States and Taiwan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reagan Brought Testy Period 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's arrival in the White House precipitated a testy period in which China 
was unsure how much support the new President would give to Taiwan. The tension 
eased with a 1982 agreement limiting U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and, ultimately, 
with Reagan's own election-year visit to China in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
During that trip, the President minimized the ideological differences with 
China that had once preoccupied American conservatives by referring to China as 
a "so-called Communist country." 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1980s, the United States and China began to set aside -- or perhaps 
postpone for the future -- their disputes over Taiwan. The two countries even 
began to collaborate on a series of military exchanges, with Pentagon officials 
making regular visits to China and leaders of the Chinese People's Liberation 
Army touring military installations in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But the two sides began to fight over other issues. China, sensitive to charges 
by Third World countries that it was aligning itself too closely with the 
United States, announced that it was conducting an "independent" foreign 
policy. The United States began to complain about China's arms sales overseas 
and to worry about China's continuing support for the murderous Khmer Rouge in 
Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trade and Students 
</P>
<P>
Whenever the two sides bicker, U.S. officials explain that ties with China 
remain strong. They point to the increasing trade between the two countries -- 
more than $13 billion this year -- and the high number of Chinese students, an 
estimated 32,000 to 40,000, being educated at American universities. 
</P>
<P>
One senior Reagan Administration official said last year that China and the 
United States now have a "mature" relationship, suggesting that the two 
countries are like a married couple, able to withstand a good fight once in a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
Some American scholars found such bland explanations irritating. "If I hear one 
more State Department official talk about a 'mature relationship' with China, 
I'm going to scream," said Robinson. "It's as if the Chinese were juveniles 
before now." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, although U.S. officials have gone to great lengths to stress the calm 
and continuity in Sino-American relations, the underlying American attitudes 
toward China have been changing in some significant ways during the last 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deng Toured U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, U.S. officials pinned their hopes for China's future largely on 
China's top political leadership. Within weeks after diplomatic relations were 
established in 1979, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping made a triumphal tour of the 
United States. U.S. officials were effusive in their praise of Deng and the 
reform program he was beginning to launch in China. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Deng is 84, and some American officials and scholars have suggested 
privately that he is becoming arbitrary and erratic in his leadership, in much 
the same way as did Mao Tse-tung in the final years before his death in 1976. 
Last spring, for example, Deng seemed to call for a lifting of price controls 
and then to pull back in the face of a spurt of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are also critical of some of the Chinese leaders who may succeed 
Deng. Speaking of Chinese Premier Li Peng, who was trained and educated in the 
Soviet Union, one Reagan Administration official said recently: "Li Peng just 
doesn't understand how a market economy works. Things won't really move in 
China until after his years in power." 
</P>
<P>
These days, American hopes for China seem to rest not on its political elite, 
but on broader, long-range developments in Chinese society -- particularly the 
tens of thousands of young students being educated in the United States and the 
market-oriented economic reforms that are taking hold in China at the 
grass-roots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Divided Over Policy 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, there appear to be serious divisions among American 
policy-makers and scholars about how the United States should approach China in 
the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Some American experts say that the United States should now base its ties to 
China primarily on economic cooperation and shift focus away from strategic 
factors such as joint opposition to the Soviet Union. "The relationship (with 
China) from the beginning has been premised far too much on anti-Soviet 
factors," Lardy said. 
</P>
<P>
But one Reagan Administration official, who said that he personally agrees with 
this argument, acknowledged: "There are still people in senior policy ranks in 
the United States who view China strictly in strategic terms." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech in San Francisco, U.S. Ambassador to China Winston Lord 
declared: "Contrary to some fashionable pundits, I strongly believe strategic 
factors will remain crucial to our cooperation with China. . . . They are more 
muted and nuanced than before. But our two nations share a continuing stake in 
preserving global and regional balances." 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, at the time they established diplomatic relations, the United 
States and China were drawn together by their eagerness to join hands against 
the Soviet Union. Now, American scholars say, nothing between China and the 
United States is quite so easy. 
</P>
<P>
"If people want a clear, compelling basis for U.S.-China relations these days, 
there just isn't going to be one," Harry Harding of the Brookings Institution 
said. "Except that we are two big countries that are going to have to live with 
one another."

TRAINS KILL 4, INCLUDING DAREDEVIL PLAYING 'CHICKEN'

<P>
Four people, including a woman on her way to work and a young man playing 
"chicken" with friends, were killed by trains in Southern California, two of 
them in Los Angeles County, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the first incident, at 7 p.m. Friday, Lorenzo Ruelas, 35, of Oxnard was 
killed when he was hit by an Amtrak passenger train traveling 70 m.p.h. outside 
Oxnard, Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Carl Schoenberger said. It has not been 
determined why Ruelas was walking on the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours later Shawn James Schultz, 21, of Escondido was playing the daredevil 
game "chicken" with friends when he put his head on the tracks and was struck 
and killed by a southbound Amtrak train in Oceanside, Officer Lori Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
The Amtrak train bound for San Diego from Los Angeles was traveling about 30 
m.p.h. to 40 m.p.h. as it moved through the city about 40 miles north of San 
Diego, said Police Sgt. Richard Derouen. 
</P>
<P>
The friends did nothing as the engine ran over Shultz because "the object of 
the game is to see how long you can stay down," Derouen explained. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 a.m. Saturday a heavily tattooed man lying on railroad tracks in Sun 
Valley was run over by a freight train and killed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The train's crew told officers they saw the man as the locomotive approached 
but were unable to stop in time, Sgt. William Meier said. The victim, who was 
carrying no identification papers, had not been identified by late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 a.m. Saturday, a woman walking to work was struck and killed by a freight 
train as she stumbled and fell across tracks in El Monte, Sgt. Steve Schuster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Louise Johnson, 30, of Temple City was pronounced dead at the scene, 
Schuster said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was carrying a small bag containing her lunch when she stumbled while 
walking across a triple-track area. She was hit when she reached to pick up the 
contents of the bag, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was still dark at the time," Schuster said. He speculated that she 
misjudged the speed of the train.

GETTING TO KNOW HIM; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIARITY WITH CURTIS R. TUCKER JR. MAY BE IN NAME ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who is Curtis R. Tucker Jr.? 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, he was a little-known legislative aide whose father -- Curtis 
R. Tucker, the feisty political patriarch of Inglewood -- was on his way to an 
eighth term as assemblyman from the 50th District. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the younger Tucker is considered the heavy favorite in a special 
election to replace his father, who died of cancer in October. One of the 
state's most powerful politicians, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco), has made it clear that he intends to use his financial and 
political muscle to get Tucker elected. Brown even persuaded Gov. George 
Deukmejian to move up the election from April 11 to Feb. 7, shortening the time 
that other candidates have to raise money and campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's heavy support for Tucker appears to have discouraged several other 
potentially strong candidates from entering the race. The four candidates who 
decided to run against Tucker are considered unlikely to raise enough money to 
compete with Brown's resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little-Known Candidate 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, many elected officials and others in Inglewood -- the political 
heart of the district -- say they know little about Tucker. The other 
candidates in the race plan to exploit the voters' lack of familiarity with 
Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
"Why hasn't he made himself known?" asks candidate Rod Wright, a veteran 
political consultant. "You don't say, 'My father did this and this, so vote for 
me.' That's not the way it works in America." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker acknowledges that he has kept a low profile in the district. While his 
brother-in-law, John Gibbs, served as the assemblyman's legislative aide in the 
50th District, Tucker worked five years as an aide to mid-Wilshire Assemblyman 
Mike Roos, the Assembly speaker pro tem, before going to work for Assemblywoman 
Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) in the neighboring 49th District eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't spent as much time in the (50th) district as I would have liked," 
Tucker said. "But I am known in the district. I know the players." 
</P>
<P>
The heir apparent is 34, a tall, husky, bearded man with glasses. In an 
interview last week, he seemed comfortable with his new role in the limelight. 
He talked freely about the issue that may dominate the abbreviated campaign: 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"If they spend all their time making me an issue, fine," he said. "I'll be 
talking about the real issues: health, crime, airport noise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Brown's Puppet 
</P>
<P>
Of his critics and rival candidates -- who dismiss him as a puppet of Brown 
whose only credential is his name -- Tucker said: 
</P>
<P>
"They're discounting what I've done for the past six years, who I know, and how 
the real world works. It's sour grapes." 
</P>
<P>
Asserting that most people in politics have a mentor, he added: "They have to 
realize the nature of politics and remember how they got where they are." 
</P>
<P>
Rival candidate Lois Hill-Hale, an Inglewood school board member and former 
aide to state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), said voters will resent 
Brown's "big boss" tactics. She said she has never encountered Tucker during 10 
years of political work in Sacramento and in the 50th District. She said many 
voters do not know that the elder Tucker has died, and she predicted that her 
opponent would exploit that confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's going to keep as low a profile as possible and hope that as many 
as people as possible will not find out that his father has passed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker responded: "A lot of people have told me, don't use 'junior' on your 
name, don't change the color of your father's campaign signs, don't use your 
picture on literature. But I'm not trying to fool anybody. I'll always be 
junior." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Follow Father's Agenda 
</P>
<P>
Tucker promises to carry on his father's policies, particularly the careful 
attention to constituents that was the foundation of the assemblyman's 
strength, along with big war chests financed by the health industry and labor. 
Tucker says his legislative office will provide "one-stop" service for 
constituents who need help. He says his differences with his father are largely 
a matter of style, though he considers himself slightly more conservative on 
issues such as crime. 
</P>
<P>
"He favored capital punishment, but I'd be more likely to use it," he said. "I 
believe it's a deterrent, and I believe it's cheaper to throw the switch than 
to pay to keep someone in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's upbringing was steeped in politics. His family was known as "the 
Tucker army" because of their involvement in the career of their father, who 
was appointed Inglewood's first black councilman in 1972, was elected to the 
Assembly two years later and eventually became Health Committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
As the third of five children and the only son of a "very strong" father, 
Tucker says he was restless and resisted his father's pressure to follow a 
rapid career path. Instead, he attended several colleges, finally earning a 
bachelor's degree in history from Cal State Dominguez Hills in 1980. He also 
worked in construction for Pacific Telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to see what was out there," Tucker said. "I liked climbing poles and 
filling manholes. It gave me a different perspective on life. My father didn't 
like it, but he knew I'd eventually get tired of getting wet and dirty." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, who is married and has two children, entered politics in 1983 as a 
legislative assistant based in Roos' 46th District field office. He acted as a 
liaison with community groups on several projects, according to people who 
worked with him, including a 1986 bill (AB 2700) to toughen penalties on 
apartment owners who did not cooperate with police against drug-dealing 
tenants. He also worked on preparing a 1987 bill (AB 1700) that provided 
incentives to the Los Angeles Unified School District to build multistory 
school buildings rather than tear down neighboring homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives the school board money to build more creatively on less land," Tucker 
said. "It suppresses the need of cutting further into housing stock." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Praised Effort 
</P>
<P>
A legislative staffer who knows Tucker's work praised his efforts on that bill. 
"The school district was happy and the homeowners were happy," the staffer 
said. "I'd give Curtis an 'A' on that one." 
</P>
<P>
The staffer described Tucker as intelligent and capable. But Tucker's work 
sometimes suffered because of absenteeism and a seeming lack of motivation, the 
staffer said: "There was some concern about the quality of his work. . . . I 
think he has the chance to be an above-average assembly member. He has the 
intellect. The question is, does he have the drive, the fire in the belly?" 
</P>
<P>
Tucker responded: "I would say that's one person's opinion. Everyone is not 
going to thrilled with your performance. That goes without saying." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, George Allen, executive director of the Wilshire Chamber of 
Commerce on which Tucker served as Roos' representative, had nothing but 
praise. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an outstanding young man and a hard worker," Allen said. "I highly 
recommend him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Positioning for Future 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Tucker's early doubts about a future in politics, he said his move 
this year to Assemblywoman Moore's office was calculated to bring him closer to 
the 50th District and position him for the future. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why his father did not hire him as an aide, Tucker said they both 
believed it was better they did not work in the same office for both political 
and personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"The press would have had a field day with it," he said. "One family member 
shouldn't work directly for another." 
</P>
<P>
But the family had a synchronized political agenda, Tucker said. Having turned 
70, Assemblyman Tucker intended his 1988-90 term to be his last; in 1990, the 
plan was for Curtis Jr. to take center stage. 
</P>
<P>
"My father always wanted to be mayor of Inglewood," Tucker said. "He would have 
run for mayor, and I would have run for Assembly in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
But the elder Tucker's death has "speeded up the process tremendously," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's sudden emergence appears to have frustrated the ambitions of potential 
rivals, such as Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent and Councilman Daniel Tabor, 
both of whom have carefully built their careers toward a run for the Assembly. 
Both have said Tucker is not entitled to the seat simply because of his name. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Has He Paid His Dues?' 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity to select among a qualified field of candidates has been 
eliminated," Tabor said. Alluding to the predominantly black voter base in the 
district, he added: "The real question is, how well does the African-American 
community manage the process of preparing leaders for the future? You tell 
people to go out and pay dues. Has he paid his dues?" 
</P>
<P>
Tucker says he has. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no prerequisite course for being a member of the Assembly," he said. 
"There should be a need to serve and a desire to do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker hopes to win election Feb. 7 by capturing more than 50% of the vote, 
thus avoiding an April 11 runoff against Mike Davis, the only Republican 
running. Tucker says his campaign plans to spend between $100,000 and $150,000 
on the race and will use an adviser from Brown's Sacramento operation, as well 
as political consultant Parke Skelton, who ran the elder Tucker's last 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Tucker said he will follow his father's lead in giving special 
attention to health matters; he hopes to work on a comprehensive package of 
health-care legislation being prepared by Brown that will be named after the 
elder Tucker. He also said that although his father had a mild aversion to 
publicity, especially television, he plans to have a higher profile and use the 
media to report on what he is doing in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's opponents look forward to confronting him on equal footing at debates 
scheduled for next month. They say Tucker's advantage will crumble when voters 
compare the candidates in person. 
</P>
<P>
But Frank Lewis, an Inglewood dentist and longtime Tucker ally, said Tucker 
will live up to his father's legacy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's quiet," Lewis said. "But he knows politics. He's well-versed. People are 
going to be surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker said: "So many people who go into politics have a puffed up sense of 
self-worth. My father never took himself seriously. . . . And I'm still the 
same person who hung off telephone poles. I have no illusions about who I am." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TUCKER ON RECORD 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't spent as much time in the (50th) district as I would have liked, but 
I am known in the district. I know the players." 
</P>
<P>
"(My critics) are discounting what I've done for the past six years, who I 
know, and how the real world works. It's sour grapes." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have told me, don't use 'junior' on your name, don't change 
the color of your father's campaign signs, don't use your picture on 
literature. But I'm not trying to fool anybody. I'll always be junior." 
</P>
<P>
"(My father) favored capital punishment, but I'd be more likely to use it. I 
believe it's a deterrent, and I believe it's cheaper to throw the switch than 
to pay to keep someone in jail." 
</P>
<P>
"My father always wanted to be mayor of Inglewood. He would have run for mayor, 
and I would have run for Assembly in 1990. (But the elder Tucker's death has 
"speeded up the process tremendously."

DYNAMO RIGA PROVES TOO MUCH FOR KINGS, 'COACH' MCNALL, 5-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Owner Bruce McNall was behind the Kings' bench for the game against the Soviet 
team Saturday night, wearing a sweater proclaiming him, "Coach." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, when they presented him with the chance to coach the team in this 
exhibition game, they expected it to be a pleasant experience. The Kings were 
supposed to beat Dynamo Riga. 
</P>
<P>
The big surprise was that Dynamo Riga defeated the Kings, 5-3, before a crowd 
of 11,490 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches wanted me to see what it was like behind the bench," McNall said. 
"I found out that it's confusing. It's upsetting. I don't know how they do it. 
. . . It was interesting. But I guess I did something wrong. Anyway, they told 
me that's the last time I coach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty humiliating for me to be canned after my coaching debut." 
</P>
<P>
It was pretty humiliating for the Kings to lose to Dynamo Riga, a young team 
that was playing its fourth game in 5 days after traveling from Calgary to 
Edmonton to Vancouver to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Dynamo Riga, the weaker of the two Soviet teams making a tour of the National 
Hockey League, had been losing ground with every game. The visitors opened with 
a 2-2 tie at Calgary, lost at Edmonton, 2-1, then lost at Vancouver, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
But against the Kings, they jumped out to a 5-1 lead before Wayne McBean and 
Wayne Gretzky narrowed the gap with third-period goals. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Robbie Ftorek of the Kings said: "We weren't trying to make light of this 
game by asking Bruce to coach, but we thought it would be a good time to let 
him see what happens during a game. 
</P>
<P>
"We might have given the impression that this game was not important to us, but 
it's only not important until you step on the ice. Then you want to win. 
</P>
<P>
"We have three big (Smythe Division) games coming up, and we wanted to play 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the third period, we asked the guys to go out and try to win the period 
to put us in a good frame of mind for going to Calgary, and they did that," 
Ftorek said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings won the final period, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
But that was after the Soviets won the first, 2-1, and the second, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Dynamo Riga Coach Vladimir Yurzinov said: "I am satisfied with how my team 
played tonight. It was a very important game for our team from a psychological 
point of view. If we had lost this game, it would have put us in a difficult 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the difference between the 2 teams, Yurzinov said: "The L.A. Kings 
were not fast tonight. The difference in their speed and ours was just about 
the same difference as between us and Vancouver." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets struck for 2 quick goals in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
On the first goal, Anatoli Semenov put his stick on the ice to deflect a pass, 
which sent the puck flying over goalie Mark Fitzpatrick's left shoulder at 
14:38. 
</P>
<P>
Andrei Lomakin got an unassisted goal at 15:31 when Fitzpatrick apparently 
thought he had made the stop, but the puck had another couple of inches of 
momentum. It glanced off his stick and into the corner of the goal . 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls scored the first goal for the Kings at 16:26 of the first 
period, a wrist shot from the left circle. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets took a 3-1 lead in the second period, taking advantage of the power 
play after Mike Krushelnyski was called for hooking. Sergei Selyanin lifted a 
left-handed slap shot over the outstretched glove of Fitzpatrick at 6:47. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets went ahead, 4-1, when Alexi Frolikov picked up a loose puck, turned 
and fired from 40 feet away. Dynamo Riga made it 5-1 when Alexander Smirnov 
sent the puck from the blue line, through traffic, and past Fitzpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
Left wing Bob Carpenter of the Kings suffered a bruised right wrist early in 
the third period and was taken to Centinela Hospital Medical Center for X-rays.

<P>
The Houston Oilers are coming, the Houston Oilers are coming. 
</P>
<P>
America's incorrigibles are on the road again, their reputations preceding 
them, threatening another hometown darling. Today it's the Buffalo Bills, 
playing their first playoff game at home in 22 years before their wild, crazy, 
longest-suffering, ready-to-party-hearty fans. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills are 3 1/2-point favorites, although a look at their recent record 
makes you wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Meet the Paper Bills? 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo had the league's best record -- 11-1 -- until losing 3 of its last 4. 
The Bills were outrushed in the losses, 232 to 110 yards, 110-39 and 53-19, an 
ominous sign for a conservative team. Also, Shane Conlan, the inside linebacker 
who was a key to their rushing defense until he missed all of the late losses, 
is expected to sit out again; quarterback Jim Kelly is under increasing fire, 
and some of it is coming from a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
That's halfback Robb Riddick, who recently told a TV station in Rochester, 
N.Y., "I just don't feel Jim is doing the job he is being paid to do." 
</P>
<P>
Riddick was upset that the backs weren't being thrown enough passes, although 
you have to wonder which games he has been watching. More than one-third of 
Kelly's completions have gone to his backs. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Marv Levy was upset with the timing of the remarks and said there was 
nothing to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Robb came back and called Jim Kelly that night," Levy said. "He told him the 
remarks came out much different than he'd expected and apologized for whatever 
embarrassment there was. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim said, 'Forget it, I know how these things happen, we've got more important 
things to deal with than that.' " 
</P>
<P>
That Kelly is a brick, isn't he? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, he may have been a tiny bit more perturbed than Levy said he was. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly is generally considered one of the game's best young quarterbacks, has 
just made the Pro Bowl over such candidates as Dan Marino and John Elway . . . 
and has been getting ripped in letters to the editor and on radio talk shows by 
the arch-supportive Bills faithful. There's a reason for it too -- try 15 
touchdown passes against 17 interceptions, compared to the 41-28 ratio he 
compiled in his first 2 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Irony: As he starts to get his greatest praise since entering the league, he's 
drawing his most heat, too. 
</P>
<P>
Bottom line: He's getting angry about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so tired of hearing about negative things," he said last week, when the 
Riddick question came up. 
</P>
<P>
But hadn't Riddick called to apologize, etc.? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," said Kelly, without enthusiasm, "he called." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Bills still have Bruce Smith (11 sacks in 12 games), 
Cornelius Bennett (9 1/2), Fred Smerlas and the rest of that rock-ribbed 
defense that got them here. The Oilers, renowned, warm-weather warriors, will 
face a more forbidding day than they got last week at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills are already braced for all of those Oiler tough-guy tactics, vowing 
not to retaliate, as the Browns' Ernest Byner did, earning back-to-back 
roughing penalties and killing a drive. However, you might conclude that the 
Oilers' Raider-type reputation is already working for them: the Bills are 
spending all this time worrying about what the Oilers will do and how they'll 
handle it. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Oilers have been on their best behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Glanville, fresh from eliminating the Browns and bringing down their 
coaching staff, took it easy on Buffalo, where he was an assistant 1 season. He 
said nothing bad about the town, which has provided fertile material for so 
many comedians, except to remark that he was leaving tickets for the late Jay 
Silverheels, the local actor who used to play Tonto. 
</P>
<P>
For a change, the most hated Oiler isn't their macho little coach but General 
Manager Ladd Herzeg. It was Herzeg who, in 1987, was accused of having made an, 
uh, impolite gesture during an argument at the team's hotel with members of a 
wedding party. 
</P>
<P>
Assault charges were filed against Herzeg but dropped by a Buffalo judge, on 
the condition that Herzeg stays out of local trouble. 
</P>
<P>
If those wedding receptions quit hassling him, he'll be fine. 
</P>
<P>
AFC Playoff Notes 
</P>
<P>
Come Back, Shane: the Bills sent Shane Conlan to Birmingham, Ala., last week to 
have Dr. James Andrews look at his injured arch which isn't responding to rest 
or therapy. Said Coach Marv Levy: "We're not counting on him, but we haven't 
counted him out." . . . Classic confrontation: Houston's offensive line, with 
its three, high No. 1 picks (Pro Bowl guards Bruce Matthews and Mike Munchak, 
and tackle Dean Steinkuhler) against the Bills' defensive front, which has four 
No. 1s (Pro Bowl players Bruce Smith, Cornelius Bennett, Conlan and Art Still) 
and two No. 2s (Pro Bowl player Fred Smerlas and Darryl Talley). . . . Key 
matchup, or Battle of the Bruces: Oiler left tackle Bruce Davis, the former 
Raider, vs. Bill right end Bruce Smith, second only to the Eagles' Reggie White 
in potential to disable an entire offense by himself. Smerlas, the colorful 
nose tackle, faces center Jay Pennison, who the Raiders considered the Oiler 
line's weak link. Of course, the Raiders thought Smerlas was a hype, too. . . . 
The Bills are 11-1 when they have rushed for more than 100 yards. However, the 
underrated Oiler defense was No. 1 in the American Football Conference against 
the run. . . . Levy, on defensing the Oilers: "They're not one dimensional. 
There's no one thing to stop. We can't say something like, 'Stop Eric Dickerson 
and you'll stop the Colts. It's not that simple. They have a superior offensive 
line, great receivers, a fine quarterback (Warren Moon) who gets better all the 
time and that tremendous stable of runners."

STEROID REPORT A REVELATION TO CIF HIERARCHY; 
</P>
<P>
'EPIDEMIC' SURPRISES ADMINISTRATORS, COACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The heads of 2 commissions that oversee athletics in all public high schools in 
Southern California said that they were surprised by the findings of a recent 
national survey indicating that 1 of every 15 boys in 12th grade has used 
anabolic steroids. Both said that they have never received a report of a 
student using the muscle-building drug. 
</P>
<P>
But a national expert on drug abuse said that steroid use among high school 
students is rising sharply and is at epidemic levels in some Southern 
California communities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a frightening situation," said Dr. Forest S. Tennant of West Covina, a 
leader in the treatment of substance abuse. Tennant has treated many 
professional athletes for cocaine dependency, including former Dodger pitcher 
Steve Howe and NBA star Walter Davis. "I have seen blood-test results from 
users of anabolic steroids. I have been shocked to see the dramatic effects 
they have on the human body." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant, who operates a drug abuse treatment center in Van Nuys, said that his 
studies have shown steroids to have a dramatic impact on the adrenal gland and 
the immune system and to cause cholesterol levels to soar in most users. 
</P>
<P>
A study published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., 
purported to be the first nationwide survey of steroid use among high school 
boys, found that of the 3,403 seniors interviewed at 46 schools, 6.6% of them 
said that they were using or had used steroids. Most said that they took the 
drug to enhance their athletic performance, but 26.7% were non-athletes who 
said that they used steroids to build muscles and improve their physical 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Thomas, the commissioner of the of the California Interscholastic 
Federation Southern Section -- which oversees more than 500 schools -- said 
that his organization has never had a report of steroid use by a local high 
school athlete. 
</P>
<P>
"None. Not a single report," Thomas said. "But I am certain it goes on. It's 
like marijuana use in your high school. You'd be crazy to say it doesn't go on. 
It's the same thing with steroids. 
</P>
<P>
"But I am just overwhelmed to hear those numbers. The numbers are scary." 
</P>
<P>
Hal Harkness, the director of interscholastic athletics for the City Section -- 
which oversees 49 Los Angeles School District programs -- said that he knows of 
no incidents involving steroid use by athletes in city schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had no calls about it, ever," he said. "I have heard absolutely no 
comments in over two years in this position from anyone in our schools 
regarding steroids." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant said that the reason for the lack of reports on steroid use by students 
is that coaches and administrators don't know what they're looking for. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are waiting to get reports on steroid use like they get reports of 
kids using marijuana or cocaine, then they will never get any reports," Tennant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Steroids are not taken in that manner, at lunchtime or at smoke break at 
school. Steroids are taken in a very programmed way, at a very intentional time 
and place, most likely away from the school. Users of cocaine and marijuana 
take those drugs when they are passed to them." 
</P>
<P>
The study reported that more than one-third of the seniors who said they have 
taken steroids took them both orally and by injection. Only one-fifth of those 
who claimed to use steroids said they got the drugs from a health-care 
professional. The majority obtained the steroids from other athletes, coaches 
and people who frequent gyms, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
Tennant said that he began to see widespread steroid use among adolescents 4 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The figures in the national study just released are not only believable, but 
in Southern California I think they are higher than that," he said. "It is 
spotty. In some communities people have never seen or heard about anabolic 
steroids. In others, it's an epidemic. As long as four years ago, I had 
substantiated reports of parents and coaches giving steroids to Little League 
baseball players and Pop Warner football players. 
</P>
<P>
"This study is a validation of something I have seen for the last four years. I 
support what it said and I agree with its findings." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant was especially alarmed at the reasons some steroid users gave for 
taking the drug. 
</P>
<P>
"The most frightening aspect of steroid use is that adolescents are using them 
to alter their basic physical appearance," he said. "They perceive that doing 
that will make them more sexually attractive or give them some success in life 
that they can't achieve otherwise. It symbolizes something that has gone sour 
in our society, that our natural body and our natural talents are not worthy 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Redell, a veteran high school football coach who recently resigned from 
his post at Crespi High, said that he encountered only 1 player at Crespi whom 
he suspected of using steroids. But he said that the results of the national 
study are not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't surprise me a bit to see those numbers," said Redell, who also 
played and coached in the defunct U. S. Football League. "The pressure on the 
kids today to win, and to perform well, is greater than ever. There are parents 
who pressure their own kids into taking steroids, not only not condemning 
steroid use but actually encouraging it. The pressure is to gain major college 
scholarships." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon High Coach Harry Welch, who has run the Valley-area's most successful 
football program for the past 7 years, said that he has never encountered 
steroid use among his players. 
</P>
<P>
"We discuss drugs but I haven't discussed steroids because I've never seen the 
need," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Welch added that he condemns steroid use, equating it with so-called 
recreational drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"It really scares me," he said. "I've read that it affects the reproductive 
system. To even flirt with using something that could affect your sexual 
identity or the future of your children . . . I would condemn it in the 
harshest way." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland High Coach Steve Landress found it difficult to believe the 
statistics, saying that he has never heard of high school athletes -- or 
students -- using steroids during his 13 years of coaching. 
</P>
<P>
He especially ruled out athletes, saying top players have no need for such 
drugs at the high school level. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys who are Division I-type players are so much better than other players 
they don't need it," he said. "Even a few years ago when it wasn't such a big 
thing to say you used steroids, I never heard anyone talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said that the Southern Section has never discussed the issue of steroids 
with coaches and has never sent memos to coaches informing them of indications 
of steroid use by players. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we felt it should be common sense," Thomas said. "If a kid goes from 
165 pounds to 205 pounds in six months, a coach should have a clue that 
steroids might be involved. I guess we assumed they would know. But I'm not 
satisfied anymore with where we are with this issue. We have to do more." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, however, said that the Southern Section has no firm plan to deal with 
steroid use. He said that the organization is involved in an educational 
program sponsored by the Los Angeles Amateur Athletic Foundation and is 
participating in another steroid awareness program sponsored by the Orange 
County Sheriff's Deparment. 
</P>
<P>
"We have run articles about steroid use in our football game programs," Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Testing players for steroids has never been seriously considered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly have to admit we have been remiss in the world of drug abuse," 
Thomas said. "Drugs are a problem in our high schools in general, but the CIF 
Southern Section should take a leadership role (against) drug abuse, including 
the use of steroids." 
</P>
<P>
Harkness said that the City Section may implement a steroid awareness program 
early next year. There will be no drug testing, however. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not even consider voluntary drug testing," he said. "To begin with, 
voluntary testing is not effective. Those individuals who even think they might 
test positively for steroids simply won't volunteer for the testing. And 
mandatory testing is absolutely out of the question. We just don't have the 
right to do that and it wouldn't even be considered." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant said that the solution is a massive and immediate educational program. 
</P>
<P>
"The educational pitch is simple," he said. "No. 1, sports are here only to 
spend a little time in your young years competing, learning team spirit and 
discipline and fitness and competition. Anabolic steroids just don't have a 
place in that. They don't belong, and don't use them. Ever. They will hurt you. 
</P>
<P>
"And we have to repeat that message to our kids, over and over. Repetition. 
That's how we got people to wear seat belts and to brush their teeth and to 
lose weight. You keep giving them this message, again and again: Don't use 
steroids."

THE YEAR IN REVIEW;

<P>
1988: A HUMBLING YEAR FOR THE MIGHTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Orange County in 1988, the natural disasters were few. The human misfortunes 
were many. 
</P>
<P>
The ground didn't shake too much, and even the drought-parched canyons did not 
ignite. True, there was the winter storm early in the year that caused the 
newly rebuilt Huntington Beach Pier to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
But that was nothing compared to the collapse of careers and the tumbling of 
stature among many of the county's once-towering figures. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year that the mighty fell: 
</P>
<P>
* A rising star in the Republican Party plummeted when he forged a signature on 
a check in a last-ditch effort to bail out his campaign for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
* A millionaire video producer from Newport Beach was charged with making 
illegal campaign contributions to failed Democratic presidential hopeful Gary 
Hart and other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
* An Orange County supervisor, running for Congress, was caught red-faced when 
it was revealed that she did not graduate from college, as her biographies 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
* Even the always-powerful Orange County Republican Party took it on the chin 
when it posted uniformed security guards at polling places in Latino areas of 
Santa Ana to warn non-citizens not to vote, prompting an FBI investigation into 
allegations of voter intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, 1988 was the election year that many people would like to forget. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the venerable Rep. Robert E. Badham (R-Newport Beach), a six-term 
congressman, surprised supporters by announcing that he would not run for 
reelection, which opened the door to a free-for-all that led to a promising 
young politician's demise. 
</P>
<P>
C. David Baker, Irvine city councilman and former college basketball star, 
seemed to be the heir-apparent to Badham's seat until C. Christopher Cox gave 
him a run for his money in the June primary. And when that money began to run 
short in the final days before the election, a desperate Baker turned to the 
bank account of a nonprofit health foundation that he directed for an advance 
on a loan that was a few days late. He wrote a $48,000 check to himself, 
signing his own name and forging the signature of a judge, a foundation 
director. He stopped payment on the check shortly after it was written, but the 
damage was done. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who was narrowly defeated by Cox, pleaded guilty to a felony forgery 
count, but a Superior Court judge later reduced the charge to a misdemeanor. 
The judge ordered Baker to perform community service and gave him a year's 
probation and a 1-year suspended jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of what the penalty was today, this will not be over," Baker said 
on the day he was sentenced. Even when the sentence was imposed, Baker was 
delivering hot meals to the elderly and working with children. "Some good will 
come out of this one way or another. I'm not really sure how." 
</P>
<P>
Another legislative seat unexpectedly opened with the death of Assemblyman 
Richard E. Longshore (R-Santa Ana) the day after voters nominated him for a 
second term. 
</P>
<P>
That opened up a king-sized contest between Republicans and Democrats for his 
seat, and that race, too, led to a finish-line stumble. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sent Out the Guards 
</P>
<P>
In their fervor to see their candidate, Curt Pringle, win, county Republican 
Party officials not only got out the vote on Nov. 8, they also sent out the 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
Uniformed security guards were hired by the party to stand watch at heavily 
Latino polling places to warn people that it was illegal for non-citizens to 
vote. The Democrats cried foul, and even high-ranking Republicans denounced the 
move. The FBI and district attorney's office are now investigating whether 
election laws were violated, and several Latino and labor organizations have 
filed suit to overturn the election results in the 72nd Assembly District, 
where Pringle ended up winning by a mere 867 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder's election foibles left her with a red face. 
Running for Congress in the June primary, Wieder conceded under pressure from 
her opponent that she had left uncorrected a 25-year-old error on her biography 
that stated she had received a bachelor's degree in journalism from Wayne State 
University in Detroit. In truth, she was unable to attend college because of 
family finances. Also under fire from slow-growth advocates for her votes on 
development agreements, Wieder lost the race. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Karl Stubbed His Toe 
</P>
<P>
Republicans did not have a monopoly on election-year problems. Stuart Karl Jr., 
the millionaire producer of the Jane Fonda workout tapes, was fined $60,000 and 
placed on 3 years' probation for making $185,000 in illegal campaign 
contributions to self-destructing presidential candidate Gary Hart and others. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, I'm not sure why I did these things," Karl said after his 
sentencing. "You're attracted to the lure of being involved. People begin to 
make you feel important. I should have looked deeper and not done the things I 
did. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Hamburger magnate Carl N. Karcher also took a tumble. Known for his fast food 
and patriotism, the founder of Carl's Jr. restaurants was accused by the 
federal government of insider trading, for allegedly tipping off his relatives 
about some bad news that his company was about to release. While a federal 
judge has ruled that Karcher's son, Carl Leo Karcher, did engage in the illegal 
behavior, the case against the senior Karcher is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
"These charges are totally false," Karcher said after the civil lawsuit was 
filed in April. "My wife and I did not sell any of our stock, nor did we tell 
anyone else to do so. . . . To suggest that any of us would intentionally 
violate the securities laws is highly offensive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crystal Cathedral Cutback 
</P>
<P>
Even God's squad was taken down a notch or two in 1988. While televangelist 
Robert H. Schuller stayed clear of the scandals that rocked his collared 
colleagues, the fallout hit the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove. In May, 
Schuller announced sharp cutbacks in his "Hour of Power" broadcast ministry, a 
result of reduced contributions because of televangelism scandal "shock waves," 
the October, 1987, stock market crash and the decision by a New York City cable 
television station to eliminate paid religious programming. 
</P>
<P>
Still, not everyone had a bad 1988. Braving the Siberian cold, marathon swimmer 
Lynne Cox of Los Alamitos became the first person to navigate a significant 
distance across the Soviet Union's Lake Baikal, the world's deepest lake. 
America's darling and Placentia's own Janet Evans won three gold medals in the 
pool at the Summer Olympics in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
And despite the misfortunes of other politicians, two former White House aides 
were launched on promising careers. Cox, after toughing it out with Baker in 
the congressional primary, sailed to easy victory in November. Dana 
Rohrabacher, after tipping off voters to Wieder's erroneous resume, was elected 
to the 42nd Congressional District post that was vacated by Daniel E. Lungren 
(R-Long Beach), who tried -- and failed -- to become the state's treasurer. 
</P>

Political Comeback 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was perhaps no bigger political comeback in Orange County in 1988 
than the one that took place on a gentle hillside in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
The honoree was not able to attend, but hundreds of supporters gathered to 
watch a bulldozer scrape up the first bucket of dirt where a library soon will 
stand to house the papers and mementos of Orange County's native son and the 
nation's only resigned president, Richard M. Nixon.

development, was defeated 55.7% to 44.3% in the June 7 primary. The initiative 
had been favored in early, pre-primary polls, but growth proponents, who 
collected and spent nearly $2 million, poured it on as the election neared. 
Those favoring growth controls spent little and campaigned less for the failed 
measure. MARK BOSTER / Los Angeles Times; Photo, Anaheim Motorcycle Officer

when about 250 feet of the pier's end was ripped off by waves such as these on 
Jan. 18. Plans are for the pier to be rebuilt, reopening possibly in the spring 
of 1991. KEN HIVELY / Los Angeles Times; Photo, A crowd of 1,500 gathered in

next to Nixon's birthplace and boyhood home, will cost an estimated $25 million 
and be privately funded. Koll Construction of Newport Beach is aiming to 
complete the library by early 1990. CHRISTINE WALTER / Los Angeles Times;

During 1988, various Orange County residents wrote about their feelings and 
thoughts in articles submitted to our Sunday commentary columns. As we look 
back, some of those thoughts are recalled: 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Fister on high-priced housing: 
</P>
<P>
I recently made my first trip back to Southern California after moving from 
Orange County. I opened up the newspaper and read, among other things, that the 
average Orange County home price is $175,000, highest in the nation. It is no 
wonder that the middle-class dream of owning a home is now out of reach for 
most young Orange County families. I'm a case in point. Before moving we lived 
in a two-bedroom apartment in Westminster for $610 a month. I accepted a job in 
Denver. We moved into a brand new three-bedroom, two-story home. It includes a 
yard, a full basement and a view of the mountains. We bought the house for 
$110,000 at a 7.8% fixed, 30-year mortgage rate. A staffing manager who 
recruits professional workers for my new company told me that the richest pool 
of engineers is in Southern California -- it's easy to lure them away because 
of the high cost of housing.

TRIPLE GOLD MEDALIST FROM PLACENTIA RATES AS ORANGE COUNTY'S TOP STORY

We want Janet. 
</P>
<P>
We want Janet shampoo (She cleaned up at Seoul, now she wants to clean up your 
scalp), we want Janet toothpaste (She'll do to your plaque what she did to the 
East Germans) and we want Janet Cliff Notes (When gold medals get in the way of 
The Great Gatsby). We want Janet-Jammies, we want JANET-LAND and yes, we want 
our JTV. 
</P>
<P>
We want Janet Evans in our newspapers and magazines, on our coffee tables and 
television screens. We want Janet because she's the best, the brightest and 
because she giggles after she wins Olympic gold medals, sets swimming world 
records or eats pizza. 
</P>
<P>
We want Janet Evans so badly that when she returned home to Placentia after 
winning three gold medals (400-meter individual medley, 400- and 800-freestyle) 
during the Seoul Summer Olympics, we practically chased her back to South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Television cameras, still photographers, newspaper reporters, magazine writers, 
TV personalities. And that was just Day 1. Taking in the crush of media-types 
onto Placentia's El Dorado High School, where Evans is a senior and reigning 
homecoming queen, classmate Shane Borowski said, "We all feel sorry for her. I 
mean, look at that." 
</P>
<P>
Evans claimed she wanted to be "Just Janet," but her commercial value has been 
assessed in mega-bucks. Still, she's balked at signing professional 
endorsements, choosing to search for a semblance of a normal life. 
</P>
<P>
Good luck. At age 17, Janet Evans was Orange County's top sports story of 1988. 
The 105-pound girl from Placentia was bigger than the play-dead Angels and 
their amazing revolving managers (Mauch-to-Cookie-to-Moose-to-Rader). 
</P>
<P>
Bigger than the Rams, whose Super Bowl hopes got as far as a wild-card game in 
Minnesota. That's where they lost under climatic conditions usually reserved 
for better shops and department stores. 
</P>
<P>
She made a bigger splash than Lynne Cox, who swam a Russian lake in search of a 
different kind of medal. (What's so funny about peace, love and understanding?) 
She was a bigger hit than Angel catcher Bob Boone, who had his best year 
batting and then bolted the Angels for the Kansas City Royals for just one 
dollar more than he earned with the Angels in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Evans headed an amazing army of Orange County athletes under 21 years of age 
who showed up their elders during the year. Placentia's Michael Chang, 16, 
became the youngest male to win a singles match at Wimbledon and went on to 
become, along with Andre Agassi, the next great hope for American tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Placentia's Michele Granger, 18, now a freshman at California, was recognized 
as the world's greatest softball pitcher, setting a dizzying array of national 
softball pitching records while at Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
There was Servite High's Derek Brown, 17, who set the county single-season 
rushing record and University of Houston running back Chuck Weatherspoon, 20, a 
La Habra High alumnus who rushed for 1,005 yards and led the nation in yards 
per carry (8.5). 
</P>
<P>
There were Elaine Youngs (El Toro), Jenny Evans (Newport Harbor) and Laurie 
Jones (Huntington Beach) who, as freshmen, played major roles on the UCLA 
women's volleyball team that went 34-0 before losing in the semifinals of the 
NCAA championships. Bob Hamelin, at age 20, batted .514 for Rancho Santiago 
College and hit a state-record 31 home runs and 105 RBIs in 48 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Mater Dei boys' basketball team won its fourth consecutive 5-A championship 
despite recruiting allegations made against its athletic programs and the 
team's failure to win the league title. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar High, with an enrollment of only 1,400, won Southern Section 
championships in girls' track, girls' tennis, water polo, football and a state 
championship in boys' cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine High girls' volleyball team won its second straight state 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
The grownups' table -- filled with resignations, firings, disappointment and 
guys named Moose -- did have some bright spots. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Louganis of the Mission Viejo Nadadores became the first male to sweep 
gold medals in diving in two Olympics. Newport Harbor's Greg Barton won two 
gold medals in kayaking during the Summer Olympics, becoming the first American 
to win a gold medal in singles kayaking. The Rams' Jim Everett set team 
single-season records for pass completions, yards and touchdowns. Receiver 
Henry Ellard set a season record for receptions. The Angels' Johnny Ray was an 
All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
But overall, it was the kids who were more than all right in 1988. And leading 
the way were . . . 
</P>
<P>
NOT JUST JANET ANYMORE 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Troup, director of U.S. Swimming Inc., had tested more than 1,000 
swimmers for energy efficiency when he came across Janet Evans. After testing 
her prior to the Summer Games, he proclaimed Evans the most energy efficient 
"male or female" swimmer today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll stop short of saying Janet's a fish," said Troup, in a Sports Illustrated 
article, "but physiologically she's very similar." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever she was, she was like nothing most people had ever seen -- three gold 
medals and one world record in events long dominated by women with thick 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
She tore through the Olympic pool with a slapping stroke that, above water, 
looked like the last desperate plea of a drowning victim. 
</P>
<P>
Experts told us what happens above the water doesn't matter, it's what happens 
below, and below the water, they said, Janet Evans was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Three gold medals made that easy to figure. But what seemed to endear Evans to 
the American public was what happened above the water: the block-long smile, 
the giggles, the absolute absence of pretense. 
</P>
<P>
She became insta-star, America's kid sister. Swimmer Matt Biondi won more gold 
medals (5), sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner was more awesome to watch, Carl 
Lewis and Greg Louganis might have proven themselves the nation's greatest 
Olympians, but no American came back from Seoul more adored than Janet Evans. 
</P>
<P>
She walked off a plane and in front of a television camera. Make that cameras. 
Returning to Placentia, the Evans' family car passed under banners thanking 
Janet, lawns drafting her ("Janet For Mayor," the placards read) and home to a 
block party attended by 500 close friends, well-wishers, strangers, gawkers and 
minicams. 
</P>
<P>
Her first day back at school was no less hectic: battalions of reporters and 
photographers descending upon El Dorado High. 
</P>
<P>
She appeared with rich man, Johnny Carson of The Tonight Show, and Poorman, on 
KROQ radio with deejay The Poorman, and received an invitation to the White 
House from The Man. 
</P>
<P>
She rode in the Disneyland Parade, the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade and was grand 
marshal of the Placentia Heritage Days Parade. 
</P>
<P>
Naively, she observed, "I've never come from a meet and had anything like this 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back with several months of perspective, she revised, "I guess I should 
have realized that it was the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
She said that sitting in a hotel room in Phoenix, the day before she was to be 
grand marshal of the Fiesta Day Parade. She has been the toast at banquets, 
luncheons and award presentations. But she has refused to sign any endorsement 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
Though the media demand for her is much less frenzied, "it's died down a lot," 
it is still constant -- there are a couple national magazine covers planned for 
her for early 1989. There are more than a few companies that would love to have 
her on their side of the debit column. But no. One call to Biondi, who did sign 
the endorsement deals, persuaded her. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he didn't have a home, that he just lived from hotel room to hotel 
room, 'just going where they tell me to,' " Evans said. "We talked to them 
(companies) and they said I could make a lot of money but it would be a 
full-time job, that I would be so busy that I wouldn't be able to finish high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"I know if I did it, I could be set for life, but finishing high school is very 
important to me, so I said no." 
</P>
<P>
And then she probably smiled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THREE IN A FISHBOWL 
</P>
<P>
Michael Chang stepped into 1988 already having the distinction of being the 
youngest male tennis player to win the U.S. Tennis Assn. national 18-and-under 
singles title and the youngest to win a singles match at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, at 16, he became the youngest to win a singles match at Wimbledon. He 
advanced to the U.S. Open's fourth round this year before being eliminated by 
the 18-year-old Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
With the best tennis players in the world now residing in West Germany and 
Sweden, Chang and Agassi's coming of age signaled hope for American men's 
tennis, which has been mired in post-Jimbo/Big Mac depression. 
</P>
<P>
Like Agassi, Chang hits the ball with amazing velocity and moves his body just 
about as fast. Pancho Segura compared him to a young Ken Rosewall. 
</P>
<P>
France's Henry LeConte succinctly summed up Chang's past, present and future 
when he said, "He moves so quickly with such good timing. I'm thinking, 
'Sixteen years old?' God." 
</P>
<P>
Michele Granger did everything in 1988 to confirm that she is the best softball 
pitcher in the world. She ended her high school career at Valencia holding 
national records for single-season strikeouts, career strikeouts, career 
no-hitters and tied the mark for single-season no-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
But while she has won numerous national and international titles -- including a 
gold medal during the 1987 Pan American Games -- she failed to win a Southern 
Section championship in her 4 years at Valencia High. Her high school career 
came to a bizarre end during a 25-inning, 3-A semifinal game against La Mirada 
that took 2 days to play. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia had 10 hits in the game but failed to score. The Tigers also made 9 
errors, 3 of which led to La Mirada's 1 run and the victory. Granger struck out 
40 in the game and afterward, in, perhaps, 1988's greatest overstatement said, 
"I let my team down." 
</P>
<P>
Derek Brown came into 1988 having performed well in 2 varsity seasons as the 
starting tailback for arguably Orange County's highest-profile football program 
-- Servite High in Anaheim. But he played in the long shadow cast by Crespi 
High's Russell White, who came into this year a two-time winner of the 
large-school division's most valuable player award. 
</P>
<P>
White began the season with the publicity, but Brown eventually made the season 
his own. In a memorable October meeting between the two backs, Brown outgained 
White 312 yards to 81 as Servite won the game 35-20. 
</P>
<P>
Brown went on to lead the Southern Section in rushing and set an Orange County 
single-season rushing record with 2,301 yards. He and Fountain Valley 
quarterback David Henigan were named co-Division 1 most valuable players. 
</P>
<P>
When it was clear that Brown was having a better season than White, the Crespi 
back quipped, "He better remember who was the originator and who is the 
imitator." 
</P>
<P>
By year's end, Derek Brown and the rest of Orange County's kid wonders made 
certain they'd be remembered for quite a while.

FIRE DOES $500,000 DAMAGE TO BRIDGE; 3 BOYS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three youths are believed to have ignited a fire Saturday afternoon that caused 
about $500,000 damage to a bridge and roadway in San Marcos, authorities said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The youths, boys ranging in age from 10 to 13, were arrested Saturday by 
sheriff's arson investigators on suspicion of starting an unlawful fire, 
according to Sgt. Julie Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses saw three young boys running from the area where a bridge on Valpreda 
Road near Mission Road was engulfed in flames, Sutton said. Sheriff's 
investigators found a large gasoline can near the fire's origin underneath the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The boys told authorities that they emptied the can into a stream running 
underneath the bridge, Sutton said. One of the boys ignited the gasoline and 
the bridge, which was made of a combination of asphalt and timber, immediately 
caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
"It put out a pretty good column of smoke," said San Marcos Fire Capt. Michael 
Marks. No one was injured in the blaze and no vehicles were damaged, Marks 
said. The bridge, about 25 to 30-feet, is closed to traffic pending a 
structural analysis, Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
The boys were taken to the sheriff's substation in Vista and later released 
into the custody of their parents, Sutton said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: Premiere of "When Harry Met Sally . . . ," the new Rob 
Reiner-directed romantic comedy from Castle Rock Entertainment (released by 
Columbia) that's sure to be the feel-good movie of the summer. A packed 
screening at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills 
preceded the packed party at the Beverly Hilton (travel time between the two 
points was a half-hour) where guests immediately dove for the lavish buffet 
dinner and listened to live big band jazz. Headlining the party, a benefit for 
Comic Relief, was the young, much-hyped jazz guy Harry Connick Jr., who appears 
on the film's sound track. While the studios were pleased with the spillover 
turnout, cramming 1,700 people into the Hilton's ballroom has the unfortunate 
side effect of making sweat break out on the upper lip. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: After a glut of action-adventure pics, the audience seemed grateful 
for a film that didn't involve semi-automatic weapon fire or decapitations. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: The movie cast and crew included director Reiner, star Billy 
Crystal (co-star Meg Ryan was filming in Hawaii), writer Nora Ephron; also 
Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, Richard Lewis, Charlton Heston, Robert Townsend, 
Rick Ducommun, O.J. Simpson, Scott Baio, Lesley Ann Warren, Shelly Long, Bud 
Cort, Carol Kane, John Larroquette, Alan Rachins and Joanna Frank, Judd Nelson, 
Shari Belafonte, Gary Owens, Fred Silverman, Garry Marshall, Ron Perlman, party 
planner Sharon Sacks (she gave the room a Manhattan feel with a skyline 
backdrop) and Comic Relief founder and president Bob Zmuda, who was very 
pleased at the $42,000 raised, which will be turned over to the L.A. Homeless 
Healthcare Project. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: Reiner's new bride, photographer Michele Singer, sweetly admitted she 
wasn't used to being asked for quotes. "I don't know if I should be the one 
quoted," she said. "I've never really done this before." Singer was reassured 
that the Quote Police wouldn't arrest her. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Mode: A mix of everything, from baggy shorts and sneakers to the 
disco-ready look of capri leggings and tight-fitting tops. There was the usual 
sea of suits (light gray and khaki for the summer months, but let's not forget 
those Armani retro ties) and a smattering of "dinner dresses." Anyone dressing 
in lightweight clothes was envied. 
</P>
<P>
The Food: The Beverly Hilton catered up a storm, including smoked salmon, 
caviar, pasta, Mexican food, crepes suzette and Caesar salad. Shelly Long knows 
how to operate at these things; she politely asked a publicist, "Can you show 
me the way to the caviar?" 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment: The crowd continued to turbo-schmooze while the band played, but 
when Connick came out, Reiner persuaded them to listen. "Find a seat, find a 
piece of floor, a lap, whatever," he implored the audience. Most of the guests 
had never heard of Connick, and when he appeared on stage his youthful face 
caused one woman to squeal, "He must be 12!" 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: A good film buoys the spirits, and it was felt at this bash. People 
wanted to stay despite the heat, the hassle-rich drive from the screening to 
the hotel, the fanny-bumping crowd and the late hour. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: The screening was accidentally overbooked, and the overflow wasn't 
entirely happy with the situation. It was quickly remedied with passes to 
another screening and the promise of dinner at the Hilton, which about 70 
people attended. The promise of food is always a good consolation prize.

It's very hard to write about people who are poorer and sadder and weirder than 
you without being condescending. Ruth Moose writes about her people with 
exasperation but real respect. 
</P>
<P>
The characters in the 19 stories that make up "Dreaming in Color" sport names 
such as Fronnie and Therma and Ladella and Thildalee. They live in somnolent 
Southern communities where any life of commerce or fun is fading fast: "The 
town is dead enough as it is," one lady thinks. "We don't need any more 
buildings to sit and watch run down. If it wasn't for the bank, drugstore, 
hardware, and Baptist Church, we could just close up shop. Strike Eddysville 
off the map -- if it's on any. I'm the only business still open on my side of 
the street and it's awful." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Moose's people tread that sad and narrow path between the hard-earned 
probity of the lower-middle classes -- bridge mints and broccoli casseroles, 
and tarnished family silver -- and the bleak wastes of hopeless White-Trashdom. 
Often the two classes share a single residential lot in town: The reputable 
families renting out a garage apartment to a poor and seedy "married" couple 
who aren't really married; who won't go to church or bring a covered dish to a 
picnic. The "wife," of course, will soon be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Last Agent 
</P>
<P>
When money and stamina are gone, ritual, however empty, seems to be the last 
agent of momentum. Life in these stories is "going through the motions," no 
more, no less. 
</P>
<P>
The motions here include "beautification projects" for sad towns dead in the 
center, women's club meetings where the women's median age is somewhere in the 
80s, Thanksgiving dinner -- in the family tradition where the relatives you 
wish would stay home show up, year after year, and the ones you love manage to 
be absent, either in body or soul. In "Judas at the Table," a depressed wife 
makes an enormous meal, while her husband peers ominously out the window, 
hating every minute of it, and her daughter stands her up cold. "Sure," the 
wife thinks resentfully of her daughter blithely skiing in the North, "sure, 
the whole Thanksgiving thing is silly to you. Family is silly. Parents are 
silly. Parents who spend themselves silly to send you to that fancy school 
because you failed two others." 
</P>
<P>
When life is limited and essentially hateful, one's only defense is to pass 
that hatred on to someone else, to step on the hands of the people on the rung 
just below you climbing that social ladder. In "Cows, Coat hangers and the K 
mart Kid," the author takes a look at life in a raw new housing development -- 
the "Friendship" of two snippy young moms, Bettye and Sally, whose only bonds 
are their spanking-clean toddlers, and their common loathing for the trapped 
house that stands between them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Their New Neighbors 
</P>
<P>
During the first part of this story, that jerry-built box is inhabited by a 
family with chronically ill children, a car that has a Kotex carton instead of 
a rear window, and a passel of sofas losing their stuffing out on the front 
lawn. Oh, disgusting! But when the "White-Trash" family moves out, a couple of 
conspicuous consumers move in. The wife wears diamond rings and a wet-bar 
appears as part of the permanent furniture. 
</P>
<P>
What's the proper response to all that? The truth is, the author reminds us, 
the whole point of being in a class system is that you're obligated to hate the 
people "above" you quite as much as the people "below." Movement in either 
direction is equally odious, and when a black couple (the only blacks in this 
whole Southern collection) moves into that same tract house, they blow the 
whole social construct sky high. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these stories are a little awkward, the collection is undeniably 
uneven, but the authorial voice is funny and strong. If you care about the 
South, if you cherish your creamed-onion recipe, if you still go through with 
family holidays not because you love them but because you should, you'll like 
this book a lot.

PRESS RELEASE USE CAUSES STIR IN TRIBUNE NEWSROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the San Diego Tribune newsroom, staffers are questioning their editors' 
definition of plagiarism when it involves press releases, after a recent 
incident involving a real-estate reporter. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, a story on Los Angeles redevelopment with Trib real estate 
reporter Herb Lawrence's byline was killed by editors when it was discovered to 
be extremely similar to an article that ran in a small Los Angeles business 
magazine. Later it was learned that the story in the magazine, as well as 
Lawrence's story, were derived from a press release. 
</P>
<P>
The story didn't run, and Tribune management apparently took no formal action 
against Lawrence. A veteran of more than 20 years with the paper, and its 
former building editor, Lawrence was suspended for a week in 1982 after he 
lifted large sections of a story from an article in an architectural magazine, 
according to published reports at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in the newsroom said that much of the redevelopment story was taken 
verbatim from the press release. Lawrence declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
"There is disenchantment far and wide in the newsroom over this," said one Trib 
staffer. "We'd like an accounting of what occurred and how it was handled. If 
it was plagiarism, does management condone plagiarism?" 
</P>
<P>
Tribune Deputy Editor Bob Witty refused to discuss specifics of the Lawrence 
case, but he acknowledged that an accusation of plagiarism was recently 
presented to him. Material from a press release was used "liberally," Witty 
said, but it was not a case of plagiarism. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look up the definition of plagiarism, it is the unauthorized use of 
someone's material," Witty said. "When someone sends you a press packet, you're 
entitled to use everything in there." 
</P>
<P>
In general, Witty said, press releases are helpful as background, but it is 
"sloppy to take things too much from releases." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, public relations people don't mind their material being used in 
articles. 
</P>
<P>
"I take that almost as flattery," one public relations veteran said. "I'd be in 
hog heaven if all my press releases were used verbatim." 
</P>
<P>
The standard industry philosophy, echoed by Witty, is that press releases 
should be used only as background information for stories. 
</P>
<P>
But such general guidelines are sometimes ignored. Quotes are taken from 
releases without being identified as prepared statements. Phrases from releases 
are used in bylined stories. Reporters, especially on small papers, simply 
rewrite press releases and put their names on the new product, adding little or 
no new information. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an absolutist," said Don Sneed, professor of journalism at San Diego State 
University. "You can't be a little pregnant. If you're going to take a 
paragraph from a press release, it's wrong. If you're going to take a handful 
of words, that's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly all papers use rewritten press releases, without bylines, especially 
as briefs in real-estate and business sections. Some, especially understaffed 
weekly papers, commonly insert press releases into the paper, without bylines, 
as news or informational stories. 
</P>
<P>
But there are gray areas. For example, what if a reporter rewrites a press 
release and adds just a sprinkling of new information? Is it fair to give the 
reporter a byline on the story? 
</P>
<P>
"The question in this case is, is he giving readers the good faith they 
deserve?" said Lee Brown, another San Diego State professor. "In my view, to 
claim for your own work that is not yours is not playing fair with the 
readers." 
</P>
<P>
Until recent times, public relations representatives often would develop 
stories for the real-estate sections of many newspapers, supplying reporters 
with quotes and detailed information. 
</P>
<P>
But times are changing. At the San Diego Union, for instance, there was a 
change in editors two years ago, the real-estate department's staff was 
increased, the section's emphasis was moved away from commercial real-estate 
news, and the policy toward press release information was dramatically changed 
to eliminate the verbatim use of press releases. This created a furor among 
public relations practitioners, some of whom talked of boycotting the section. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Union's real-estate section's policy is to attribute the source if a 
quote or information is used from a press release, according to Lizanne 
Poppens, news editor of the Union's Home section. 
</P>
<P>
"It was probably commonplace to have more of an industry approach to 
real-estate news in real-estate sections throughout the country," local public 
relations veteran Jim Frampton said. "About 10 years ago, the trend began 
throughout the industry toward more consumer-oriented sections. There was less 
of a reason to quote Joe Blow from XYZ Builders on the economy," precipitating 
a de-emphasis of press release-supplied information. 
</P>
<P>
The use of press release information in stories has been questioned in the 
Tribune newsroom in the past. A year ago, a columnist was accused of copying a 
few paragraphs from a press release. The Lawrence case has simply raised the 
topic again. 
</P>
<P>
"To do nothing about it reaffirms reporters' laziness" toward press releases, 
one Tribune staffer said. "It's telling them it's OK to do this type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
XTRA-FM (91X) Program Director Trip Reeb is leaving the station to become 
general manager of KROQ in Los Angeles, the granddaddy of the "Cutting Edge of 
Rock" format used by 91X. KROQ's ratings have been foundering lately, and it is 
facing a stern new challenge from KQLZ-FM (Pirate Radio). Reeb replaces Tony 
Berardini, who remains vice president of the station, as well as general 
manager of KROQ's sister station in Boston. Reeb will leave 91X in two weeks, 
after a year and a half with the station. "We wanted someone with an overall 
sense of the radio station who could be here all the time," a KROQ spokeswoman 
said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
XTRA-FM is touting its success in the recently released Birch ratings, which 
lists the station No. 1 among listeners 12 and older. The Birch book tends to 
reflect young listeners more than the commonly used Arbitron system because it 
uses phone surveys instead of the written diaries favored by Arbitron. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In this summer of sequels, it is fitting that KNSD-TV (Channel 39) is once 
again exhorting viewers to send their excrement to Thrifty. Called the "Test 
for Life II," the station is offering free screenings for colorectal cancer to 
those who bring stool samples to the stores. More than 59,000 samples were 
brought in during the first Test for Life in 1987, the station said, with 553 
testing positive. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KPBS-TV's "The Art and Vision of James Hubbell" has been picked up by the 
national PBS prime time network, which includes more than 300 stations. No air 
date has been announced . . . . 
</P>
<P>
There's "Public People, Private Lives," the schmaltzy syndicated talk show 
hosted by Sarah Purcell, and then there's "Public People, Private Lives," the 
locally produced talk show that airs on cable systems throughout Southern 
California. Attorneys for David Eisenberg, producer and host of the local 
program, have sent a letter to Orbis Communications, distributor of the other 
show, advising it that his show was on the air first and thus is entitled to 
the name. No reply yet, and Orbis representatives didn't return a reporter's 
calls last week. The Purcell version isn't exactly burning up the airwaves, so 
Eisenberg said he has been advised to "wait and see" if the show even stays on 
the air.

HARRELL, BRONFMAN, SETZER SIT IN AT INSTITUTE CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some prodigiously talented, aspiring young players got some expert help Friday 
night when members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute performed three 
chamber works at Schoenberg Hall, UCLA. Three mentors supplemented the forces 
-- artistic director and cellist Lynn Harrell, Emerson Quartet violinist Philip 
Setzer and pianist Yefim Bronfman. 
</P>
<P>
As one could have anticipated, the virtuosic collaboration of Harrell and 
Setzer in Ravel's Sonata for Violin and Cello (1920-22) became the centerpiece 
of the concert. Harrell's witty, bubbly style and Setzer's more serious, almost 
brooding approach successfully blended and comprehensively explored each 
carefully written nuance of the score. 
</P>
<P>
A last-minute substitution of the Schubert Trio, Opus 99, for the Beethoven 
Quartet Opus 95, yielded some pleasantly surprising results as well. Violinist 
Helen Nightengale rose to the occasion with a commanding performance filled 
with delicate but controlled lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
The last piece on the program, Beethoven's Quintet for Piano and Winds, Opus 
16, proved more problematic. Despite the spirited, polished accompaniment 
provided by Bronfman, the wind players suffered myriad intonation problems, due 
at times to overblowing, but also to a general lack of energy.GREGG WAGER

MCENROE TO MISS DAVIS CUP BECAUSE OF INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, Times Sports Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The highly anticipated Davis Cup matchup between the United States and West 
Germany this weekend took on a new light Sunday with the withdrawal of American 
star John McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, who holds just about every U.S. Davis Cup record for matches played 
and victories, withdrew because of tendinitis in his serving shoulder, an 
injury that he suffered during a doubles match at Wimbledon. After he hurt his 
shoulder at Wimbledon, he lost to Stefan Edberg in three close sets in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe's replacement will be Brad Gilbert, the Northern Californian who has 
played Davis Cup for team captain Tom Gorman before, who won a bronze medal for 
a U.S. team led by Gorman at the '88 Olympics in Seoul and who has a history of 
being a difficult opponent for German star Boris Becker. Gilbert has beaten 
Becker in three of their four meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Gilbert over young American star Michael Chang, the Placentia 
player who won the French Open in May, has the potential to be controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman, contacted Monday morning in Munich, said that he talked directly to 
Chang in the middle of last week, when McEnroe began to indicate he might not 
be able to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Michael and was told he would not be available," Gorman said. 
</P>
<P>
Chang's father, Joe Chang, when reached in Placentia Sunday night, said that he 
had heard nothing about McEnroe's inability to play. 
</P>
<P>
"That is news to me," Joe Chang said. "The last we heard, John was healthy and 
ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that his family and Michael had just returned from a fishing trip, 
and that his son was mentally and physically tired after having been away from 
home for 2 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman said he also spoke to Tim Mayotte, a fast-court specialist who would 
appear to be well-suited for competition on the fast Pegulan carpet the match 
will be played on in Munich's Olympia Halle Friday, Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly, I'm concerned with the players who are going to play," Gorman said. 
"I'm sure that those who couldn't make it all had valid reasons. The lateness 
of this situation made things difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to have Brad Gilbert here. When I called him, he didn't even pause 
or ask any questions. He just said, 'When do you want me there?' I really like 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"And it has been interesting to watch the German press. You (American press) 
have asked more questions about picking Gilbert than eight or so of them did in 
a full press conference. They seemed quite concerned about Gilbert. They know 
he has beaten Becker a lot, and they know he has also handled Eric Jelen many 
times over the years. They see Gilbert as a real threat." 
</P>
<P>
Gorman said that McEnroe started to talk about not being able to play about the 
middle of last week, but he needed to have more tests by doctors. Once those 
tests were completed Friday, the diagnosis was that he could seriously injure 
himself if he tried to play in Munich and that he needed three to six weeks of 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
With McEnroe missing, Gilbert will be joined by Andre Agassi to play singles 
against Becker and Carl-Uwe Steeb and Robert Seguso and Ken Flach will face 
Becker and Jelen in doubles.

COSTA MESA COUNCIL TO DEBATE FATE OF SOS, WHICH SOME NEIGHBORS SAY DOES NOT 
BELONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jean Forbath glanced knowingly at the note that the Latina had brought. It was 
a plea for assistance written by an emergency-room nurse who had treated the 
70-year-old woman for a chronic heart ailment. 
</P>
<P>
Forbath, founder and director of SOS (Share Our Selves), pointed to a drawer 
full of index cards that recorded the woman's dozens of visits to the SOS 
center over the years. "This is how many times we have helped her, because no 
one else will," Forbath said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1971, SOS has been serving those caught at society's bottom rung by 
offering food, clothes, free medical care and other aid. Last year, it spent 
about $600,000, most of it from private donations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Desirability of Clientele 
</P>
<P>
But that effort may soon end, a victim of community conflict over the 
desirability of SOS's clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight the Costa Mesa City Council is scheduled to debate whether to evict SOS 
from its longtime home at the Rea Community Center in the city's west side. 
Hundreds of residents, both supporters and opponents of SOS, are expected to 
jam the council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is about our rights for a quiet, peaceful neighborhood. That's all we 
want," said Barbara Littrell, who lives opposite the center and has urged that 
SOS be closed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not against what SOS is doing," she said. "They just don't belong in 
our neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Forbath sees irony in the reaction of such neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Services, Greater Backlash' 
</P>
<P>
"The more services (for the needy) the community has developed, the greater the 
backlash," she said. "It is a counterswell of reaction to any threat to our 
(status) as a middle-class bastion that Orange County has seen itself as for so 
long. We have been in Costa Mesa for 19 years, and only now are we having these 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
If SOS is forced to leave Rea center, it will probably mean the end of its 
programs, Forbath said: "We could not afford the rent or meet other 
restrictions we would encounter if we tried to move to another location." 
</P>
<P>
Studies of the people SOS serves show that the center is in the right location, 
she said. According to SOS surveys, the group serves 6,000 to 7,500 people a 
month, about 5,000 of whom are Costa Mesa residents. Two-thirds of those live 
within walking distance of the Rea center. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Littrell, who was on a city-government task force to study the impact 
of SOS on the neighborhood, said she has statistics showing that only about 25% 
of SOS's clients are from Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides have been signing up supporters on petitions to present to the City 
Council. Forbath said SOS has collected the signatures of more than 3,000 Costa 
Mesa residents who support SOS, most from west side neighborhoods. Littrell 
said SOS foes have "thousands" of signatures. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of other organizations in Costa Mesa that have food programs 
and other assistance," Littrell said. "I don't see that these people are going 
to fall on their faces if this one is closed." 
</P>
<P>
Early one recent morning, Forbath surveyed the crowd that had already gathered 
at the center. There were young, white teen-agers, a black man with a toddler, 
Latina mothers with their children, single men and women, couples with no 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Most have problems that fall between the cracks in government aid programs, 
such as the dilemma faced by the 70-year-old Latina. The bill for her emergency 
visit to the hospital for a heart condition was paid with government health 
funds, but she had to go to SOS for money to fill her prescription. 
</P>
<P>
By 9 a.m., stub No. 52 had already been picked up. The temperature would reach 
more than 100 degrees and the clock would reach 1 p.m. before No. 52 was 
called. 
</P>
<P>
"No. 30, treinta, No. 30, treinta," Forbath called through a public address 
microphone. The volume was turned high because of the constant noise, like a 
bus station full of adults talking, children playing or crying and people 
shuffling in and out the door. 
</P>
<P>
To Forbath, who founded SOS 19 years ago, it seemed a fairly quiet, easy day. 
</P>
<P>
No. 30 was a Latina mother with two little girls. The woman struggled with her 
English, and Forbath struggled with her Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The woman told about how hard it had been to find work since the new 
immigration laws took effect. She was broke and wanted to return home to 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Forms, No Questions 
</P>
<P>
There were no forms to fill out or questions to test her story. Forbath said 
the premise of SOS is that it would be worse to withhold money from someone in 
need than to give money to someone dishonest. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is going to get rich off of this, no matter what," she said. "Anybody 
who would wait this long to get this little has to need some help." 
</P>
<P>
Forbath looked up the bus fare to Tijuana and wrote a check to the bus company. 
Then she wrote another check for $50, money the woman could spend as she 
pleased. Before the family left, Forbath gave the girls toys: a green, plastic 
jump rope and two plastic kazoos. 
</P>
<P>
No. 35 was a thin white man about 50 years old with a stubble beard, blue 
jeans, boots and a big silver belt buckle reading "The State of Texas." He said 
he had done "spot labor" lately and used to drive trucks. He had a wife and a 
16-year-old daughter. His rent was due, but he would not have any money for two 
more days. 
</P>
<P>
Forbath asked whether he had ever applied for welfare. "I've never been on 
welfare, and I don't like it," he replied, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Forbath showed him a list of unskilled jobs available and wrote him a $42 check 
for two nights in a nearby hotel. 
</P>
<P>
There are other social service groups based at the Rea center. Within the 
former junior high school, surrounded by a neatly clipped lawn, a 
boys-and-girls club holds its meetings, a day-care center serves senior 
citizens and another agency serves disabled patients. 
</P>
<P>
There once was a soup kitchen as well, but it was ordered closed by the City 
Council several months ago after neighbors complained about the people it 
attracted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Going to Be Bad Apples' 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of SOS, including soup kitchen operator Merle Hatleberg, had hoped 
closing the charity would relieve some of the congestion around the center and 
appease unhappy neighbors, leaving SOS free to operate. The City Council agreed 
to wait and see; a report on the outcome will be presented at tonight's council 
meeting.

Littrell said: "We didn't see any major improvement. When you bring that many 
people into a neighborhood, there are going to be bad apples who heckle 
children, cause trouble. . . . We still feel threatened. . . . There are still 
people sleeping in the park."

<P>
But Costa Mesa City Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle said police reports do not 
corroborate allegations that crime has increased around the Rea center or that 
patrons of the center disturb residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I live close enough to the center that I drive by every day, and I see little 
impact on the neighborhood," Hornbuckle said. "I'm still waiting for hard 
evidence that shows those concerns are real. I'm just hoping reality prevails 
and that Costa Mesa's historical, traditional compassion comes through." 
</P>
<P>
"There are no easy answers," Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis said. "I have to 
honestly say that I wouldn't want to live by the center, so I don't know if 
it's right, as a councilwoman, to say someone else should. 
</P>
<P>
"But at the same time, where do you send all those poor people? It's difficult, 
because normally even if you're in the minority on an issue, if you know you're 
in the right you can feel good. But in this case there are so many grays."

Police continued their search for suspects Sunday after a Santa Ana man was 
killed and two of his friends were wounded early Saturday in what investigators 
classified as a gang-related shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Bob Clark said the shooting took place at 1:30 a.m. in a convenience 
store's parking lot at the corner of Warner Avenue and Pacific Street. Three 
young men in a car pulled up next to another car and opened fire with a 
semiautomatic assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Anthony Brooks, 19, was shot once in the head and died instantly, police 
said. Michael Serrano, who was at the wheel of the car, was shot in the chest. 
A second passenger, Johnny Guerrero, 20, was shot once in the right buttock. 
</P>
<P>
Serrano was in stable condition and Guerrero in good condition at Coastal 
Communities Hospital. Both are from Santa Ana.
