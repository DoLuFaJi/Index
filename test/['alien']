What follows on the next several pages of Calendar is Hollywood at its best -- 
and worst. 
</P>
<P>
Of the nearly 450 titles compiled here (down about 100 from last year's 
listing, due to a drop in film production) some may be critical darlings and 
some may be blockbusters. Most will be stinkers. 
</P>
<P>
But we as filmgoers hope there will be enough in this compendium of productions 
that will be worth the price of our time and money. Or, at the very least, the 
cost of a video rental. 
</P>
<P>
As you read, you might find yourself thinking that you've read this plot 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Be forewarned: Certain words -- like murder, revenge and kidnaping -- pop up 
with regularity. And not just in movies with no-name casts, made by small, 
no-name companies; the studios also are promising story lines having to do with 
murder, revenge and kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
The story lines often are replete with webs to entrap heroes. We discovered all 
kinds of them as we sorted through publicist-supplied plot lines. There were 
webs of intrigue, webs of deceit, webs of horror. And even webs of revenge. 
</P>
<P>
Along with sound-alike plots, some of the movies may have titles that you swear 
you've heard before. You have. 
</P>
<P>
(In the case of "Lawrence of Arabia," it will soon have a special reissue -- 25 
years later -- with never-before seen footage.) 
</P>
<P>
A number of our titles are returnees from last year and a smattering are making 
their third appearance on our annual listing. They were produced and have since 
been languishing, sometimes due to a web of red tape involving 
distribution-ownership woes. Some never got made. As we were told solemnly by 
the rep for one small production company (with a single, low-budget film for 
our list), "We'd like to think that we are going to release the film, but 
there's no guarantee. Look at 'Heaven's Gate' . . . You just never know if a 
film is going to be released until you screen it and see what you have." 
</P>
<P>
As with each year's compilation, we went through our own adventures. 
</P>
<P>
All Universal Studios would say about a Steven Spielberg-directed project was 
that it was . . . "An Untitled Love Story Directed by Steven Spielberg." 
</P>
<P>
But isn't he supposedly going to film "Always," a love story based on the '40s 
Spencer Tracy film, "A Guy Named Joe"? A call to Spielberg's Amblin 
Entertainment brought a response in the affirmative. But, we were told, 
unaccountably, the project should not be identified as "Always"/"A Guy Named 
Joe." 
</P>
<P>
The studio also wouldn't tell us the plot to a planned Jetsons movie -- which 
is based on the animated TV series! 
</P>
<P>
One super-budgeted, super-star, super-silly fantasy sent a single photo that 
was so dark, one of the stars faded into the background. 
</P>
<P>
One company, producing another sequel, sent pictures from its last sequel. 
</P>
<P>
Then there were the super-secretive productions that didn't want to send any 
photos. In the beginning, the folks at Warner Bros. were so nervous over their 
big-bat-budget "Batman" -- especially in regard to the controversial casting of 
Michael Keaton as the Batguy -- that we weren't going to get any art. Then came 
a possibility that we might get shots of Keaton as Bruce Wayne, alter ego of 
the Caped Crusader. Finally, at the last minute, in flew a picture of Keaton in 
Batgarb. (See our cover.) 
</P>
<P>
For our annual advisory, note that the listings are all subject to change. 
</P>
<P>
That includes stars, film makers, titles and plots. Some movies' scripts have 
yet to be written. 
</P>
<P>
Release dates, especially, could vary widely. Distributors are always looking 
to achieve the best effect. 
</P>
<P>
The wherever and whenever can vary. As one small distributor told us, "Our 
movie may play somewhere like Georgia, then go to video. It depends." 
</P>

OK, there were a few gaffes in our Sneaks '89. It is Edward S. Feldman -- not 
Ed Pressman -- who is producing "Wired" with Charles Meeker. The Francis Ford 
Coppola-directed segment of "New York Stories" stars newcomer Heather McComb, 
not Coppola's daughter, Sofia. Sofia co-wrote the script with her father and 
also designed the costumes and titles. Merrin Holt and Ken Krauss are the 
writers of the comedy "Buy and Cell," not director Robert Boris. And the 
vampire picture "To Die For" -- which we labeled "distributor pending" -- will 
be distributed by Skouras Pictures in March.

CRITIC'S NOTES: A TRIO OF EXCEPTIONAL MOVIE WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whatever their other exceptional qualities, "The Accidental Tourist," "Working 
Girl" and "My Stepmother Is an Alien," three of the holiday's comedies -- or 
semi-comedies or would-be comedies -- have an especially interesting trio of 
women characters. And they are played by actresses whose sheer adorability 
level is phenomenal: Geena Davis, Melanie Griffith and Kim Basinger. 
</P>
<P>
These are actresses who are liked, if that's not too passive a word, by men and 
women equally, already a rare and pleasant phenomenon. Each one plays a gutsy 
outsider -- way, way outside, in the case of Basinger's extra-terrestrial -- 
and each one is resilient and resourceful, exactly as we've come to expect 
contemporary, liberated heroines to be. They are the creations of very 
different writers and directors; a novelist, a playwright/screenwriter and a 
phalanx of comedy writers. Yet the way each woman's character works seems to 
reflect the retrenchment around us more than any liberated successes. These are 
very definitely "vive la difference" ladies; they revel in it, and audiences 
seem to revel right along with them. 
</P>
<P>
The charismatic outsider, shattering complacency and safe behavior, is hardly 
new; if there are reportedly only a dozen basic plots in the world, that one is 
probably No. 2. We've seen that character in Darryl Hannah's mermaid in 
"Splash," as Melanie Griffith -- again -- in "Something Wild," Michelle 
Pfeiffer in "Married to the Mob," Whoopi Goldberg in "Clara's Heart" or Dustin 
Hoffman in "Rain Man." Such forces aren't always benign; a few years ago, in 
"Smooth Talk," it was Treat Williams' terrifying Arnold Friend. 
</P>
<P>
Such jolting characters are more often men, and men whose characters are more 
richly detailed: Eddie Murphy in "Trading Places," Nick Nolte in "Down and Out 
in Beverly Hills" (and before that, his prototype in "Boudu Saved From 
Drowning," Sidney Poitier in "In the Heat of the Night," and Robin Williams in 
almost everything but especially "Moscow on the Hudson" and "Good Morning, 
Vietnam." "Gandhi" and "The Last Temptation of Christ" are built around exactly 
such obstreperous men. The only newness to this season's model is that now 
these classic shaker-uppers are enormously appealing women. 
</P>
<P>
Beautiful actresses with a nice comic bent are invariably called their decade's 
Carole Lombard, but that doesn't hold here. Lombard, even when she was playing 
a hick, was clearly a sophisticate. And she was a feminist before her time. 
Bring her back now and those qualities would only be intensified. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever other remarkable qualities Basinger and especially Davis and 
Griffith's characters possess, they're more earthy than sophisticated. Basinger 
is vastly knowledgeable, of course, but you could never call that gurgling 
giggle the weapon of a sophisticate and no one is going to call any of them 
them feminists. Pungent confrontation is not their style, nor is forging ahead 
on their own. They succeed by acting as catalysts in the lives of their men. 
</P>
<P>
Geena Davis's Muriel Pritchett gently challenges William Hurt's Macon Leary 
back to life, out of his profound mourning for the death of his 12-year-old 
son. Off-center, clearly "unsuitable" but radiantly positive, Muriel is a risk 
taker, drawing Macon to risk a little of himself, in contrast to his wife of 20 
years Sarah (Kathleen Turner), who understands him so completely that he has no 
room left to grow or to surprise himself. 
</P>
<P>
As Celeste, the alien (and the only conceiveable reason to endure this 
strained, charmless "comedy"), Basinger forces Dan Aykroyd's widower scientist 
to greater achievements, almost in spite of himself. He has made a great 
scientific leap inadvertently. Now to save her planet and because she knows the 
basics of his work herself, Basinger inspires him to duplicate his triumph and, 
presumably, to build from it. 
</P>
<P>
With Harrison Ford in tow, Melanie Griffith's Tess McGill impulsively crashes a 
society wedding in order to make a crucial business contact. Her chutzpah makes 
Ford's corporate type cringe, but only until he gets used to the idea. Once the 
ruse is working, he's as inspired at improvisation as she is. 
</P>
<P>
What all three women do is to open doors for these slightly square men, but 
they're in no hurry to bolt through them themselves. That would apparently be 
unseemly, unwomanly aggressiveness. To drive home that point, a large part of 
"Working Girl's" fun comes from watching Sigourney Weaver, as just such a 
woman, get hers. 
</P>
<P>
Does this trio succeed only because they are adorable, gorgeous or cuddly? 
We're not supposed to think so. A lot of screen time and a great deal of ink is 
expended to show just us how smart they are. Basic smarts, dimmed only slightly 
by lack of advantage in at least two cases. 
</P>
<P>
These women are real, or the movies' equivalent of real, which means blue 
collar and struggling. (We except Basinger, whose whole civilization is so far 
above our own that you wonder why she bothers to trifle with any of us, once 
she had what she wanted.) You might take film reality with a grain of salt; as 
a friend remarked acerbically after "Working Girl," "Sure, she succeeds because 
she's so smart; it doesn't hurt that she also looks sensational running around 
in her teddies, either." 
</P>
<P>
We take from movies reflections of life or ways of behaving. Out of this trio 
of love stories, from very different sources and sensibilities, what seems to 
have emerged is a woman who mixes the pure lovability of a '50s Marilyn Monroe 
with contemporary accomplishment and intelligence. She's a strange hybrid, and 
perhaps her success with today's conservative-leaning audiences is that she 
soothes sensibilities ruffled by the strides of liberation. 
</P>
<P>
But you know how potent these images are when you hear, as I did last week, an 
accomplished, extremely successful and beautiful woman say that she studies 
these actresses fascinatedly, to see how the "girly-girls" work. She may learn, 
but I wouldn't count on it working outside of the movies.

JUDGE REMOVES CITY, 3 OFFICERS FROM SUIT OVER BORDER SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge Friday removed the city of San Diego and three city police 
officers as defendants in a $20-million wrongful-death suit stemming from the 
shooting death of an illegal alien near the U. S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
Police Officer Cesar Solis remains as the sole defendant in the case. Court 
testimony indicated that a shot fired by Solis most likely resulted in the 
death of Julio Arroyo Zaragoza, a 33-year-old illegal alien from Mexico who was 
killed May 4, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
After a weeklong trial, the case is scheduled to go to the jury next week. Both 
sides rested their cases Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officer Saved by Vest 
</P>
<P>
The shooting generated a whirlwind of controversy at the time. A Border Patrol 
officer, Fred Stevens, was shot five times during the incident but survived, 
thanks largely to a bulletproof vest, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo's family, which is pressing the suit, has maintained through their 
attorney, Jose E. Tafolla of San Diego, that Arroyo was the victim of a 
"summary execution" by members of the Border Crime Prevention Unit, a special 
task force of officers from the San Diego police force and the U. S. Border 
Patrol. Unit members patrol the border canyons seeking to deter crime against 
illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge Gordon Thompson Jr. ruled that evidence indicated it was 
"ludicrous" to contend that any city policy resulted in the alleged "execution" 
of Arroyo. The three other officers named in the suit -- Larry K. Bender, M. 
Mendez and M. Rosario -- did not shoot Arroyo and therefore should be dropped 
as defendants, the judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflicting Testimony 
</P>
<P>
Much of the testimony during the trial has focused on conflicting comments from 
pathologists as to whether Arroyo was shot at close range -- that is, whether 
he received a so-called "contact" type wound that is associated with 
execution-style slayings. Two experts called by the family testified that his 
wound might fall into that category, while two pathologists called by the city 
said the wound was inflicted from a greater distance. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have maintained that the shooting was justified because Arroyo and 
his brother Jaime had been robbing aliens with weapons and attempted to shake 
down the task force when the confrontation occurred. Jaime Arroyo, who survived 
the incident, was convicted of conspiring to commit robbery and of attempted 
murder and is serving a nine-year term at Soledad State Prison. 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo's widow, Maria de Zaragoza, and her four children, residents of Mexico 
City, have contended that the two brothers were guides leading a group of 
migrants through the canyons when they were attacked by the officers, whom the 
Arroyo brothers thought were bandits. The family charges that Julio Arroyo was 
shot through the center of his forehead as officers were placing handcuffs on 
his wrists.

EXTINCT IN THE LAND OF FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
WHO WILL REMEMBER THE PEOPLE BY JEAN RASPAIL; TRANSLATED BY JEREMY LEGGATT 
(MERCURY HOUSE: $18.95; 215 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Schmitt , Schmitt is a professor of Latin American literature at CSU 
Long Beach whose latest work is a translation of Chilean poet Raul Zurita's 
Anteparadise (University of California Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The four tribes of the now-extinct native Americans that once inhabited the 
Tierra del Fuego archipelago -- that ships' graveyard along the land's end, 
southern tip of South America -- were among the most primitive and hardy 
peoples encountered in the New World. In this fine piece of historical fiction 
cum-exemplary story, French novelist Jean Raspail explores the sad fate of the 
Alacalufs (who called themselves Kaweskar, "The People"), the lesser known of 
the two tribes of sea-nomads or "canoe Indians." 
</P>
<P>
Raspail reconstructs the history of the Alacalufs through their own eyes and 
those of Magellan, Drake and other historical figures. In this noble quest of 
the "other" (those whose languages and customs seemed so alien to Europeans 
that they refused to admit that they belonged to the human species), the view 
from "within" is attempted through a synopsis of generations, of millennia, in 
the mind of the character Lafko, a kind of collective memory of the Alacalufs. 
The view from "without" reveals a shameful history of smug disdain: From 
Magellan on, Europeans judged the Alacalufs to be "ugly," "stinking," 
"disgusting," "brutish," "beasts," "animals"; they kidnaped them, enslaved them 
and, at worst, their genocidal instincts unleashed, they turned their guns and 
cannons on them for sport, exterminated them; in the end, they were hunted for 
bounty or herded into missionary stations where they died of white man's 
diseases or the despair of captivity, and the last stragglers were reduced to 
bartering and begging in the shipping lanes of the Strait of Magellan. The 
complicity of scientists (like Darwin) in fostering this outcome is addressed 
in a couple of the chapters. 
</P>
<P>
The other side of the coin -- that our survival, too, depends on our ability to 
embrace others not as a function of our own ideal but of theirs -- is seen in 
the tragic fate of the inhabitants of Name of Jesus and the City of King 
Philip, Spain's first settlement communities in Tierra del Fuego,who went mad 
or starved to death. The English privateer Cavendish rechristened the latter 
city Port Famine. 
</P>
<P>
The point is brought home in the moving chapter, "A Civilized Gentleman." Sir 
John Byron, shipwrecked in the Strait in his youth and rescued by the 
Alacalufs, returns to the scene years later and ponders the legacy of European 
contacts: "What an endless history of contempt is unraveled! And yet . . . ." 
An instinct for survival had not saved his fellow castaways. He alone had 
survived by crossing the cultural abyss and living with the Alacaluf clan for 
six months, and the clan had braved the seas and their fears of the world 
beyond their territory to set him down on an island from which Chilotan seal 
hunters returned him to Puerto Montt. 
</P>
<P>
But when Raspail attempts to give us a glimpse from within (the inner life of 
the Alacalufs), the reader is aware of a European mind wedged between him and 
the "other." The Alacalufs are "endlessly fleeing," "forsaken" pariahs, 
"commanded by fate to survive, not to live" in a land shrouded in "an eternally 
black sky," "a witches' dance of cruel winds," "a hell of snow and winds." 
</P>
<P>
But this area is also stunningly beautiful, and Father Martin Gusinde has 
compared the Yamana, a sister tribe, to 'fidgety birds of passage who were 
happy and inwardly calm only when they were on the move'). In two recent works, 
Bruce Chatwin ("The Songlines") and Mario Vargas Llosa ("El Hablador" ("The 
Speaker") ) convincingly draw the reader into the soul-life, the Earth-bound 
myths and legends of the Australian Bushmen and the Peruvian Machiguengas, 
respectively. Raspail is far less successful in a parallel attempt with the 
Alacalufs, and the fault is not in Jeremy Leggatt's translation, which is 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that limitation, Raspail's story, inscribed in the dialogue of cultures 
so characteristic of our age, is a fine version in historical fiction of a true 
story loud with ethical reverberations. As First-World nations, we are 
collectively responsible for the fate of colonized and subjugated peoples in 
the Third World, but we have hardly begun to address those responsibilities.

THE WORD ON 'TALK RADIO'; 
</P>
<P>
ERIC BOGOSIAN FINDS STORY IN THE 'FRINGE ELEMENT' OF THE MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time, "Talk Radio" was a small play that writer-performer Eric 
Bogosian and Portland, Ore., artist Tad Savinar developed at the Portland 
Center for the Visual Arts, and then moved to Joe Papp's Public Theatre in New 
York in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
It gathered attention to itself, but it was benign fame, scaled to the 
intimate, often insular theater world. 
</P>
<P>
The attention -- centered on Bogosian, whose reputation was reaching a zenith 
after cultivating the New York borderland between performance art and the stage 
for 10 years -- was enough to get producer Ed Pressman interested in making a 
movie out of what was basically a monologue by a guy behind a mike. 
</P>
<P>
And now, just as Oliver Stone's film version (co-scripted with Bogosian) has 
changed the play, so the reaction has changed. "Talk Radio," the movie, is 
controversial stuff -- especially on the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
In the film's opening weeks, it's been difficult to turn on a talk show and not 
hear on-air exchanges about it. And it's often the talk show hosts themselves 
who issue the most cutting attacks on "Talk Radio" (see Judith Michaelson's 
accompanying article). 
</P>
<P>
For Bogosian, a lot of it is hot air. 
</P>
<P>
"To slam a movie about hate radio for fostering hate is like saying that a 
movie about the Ku Klux Klan will foster the Klan," he says, adding that the 
death threats against Barry Champlain, "Talk Radio's" shock jock, are not the 
imaginings of a feverish, Hollywood-inspired imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"A radio host in Pittsburgh showed me written threats he received." Yet to be 
completely authentic to all facets of a radio show, Bogosian notes, "would turn 
the movie into a stiff. Most radio stations are pretty uneventful." 
</P>
<P>
What about complaints that a Champlain-type host would never get a three-day 
notice, as happens in the movie, before getting launched on a national network? 
</P>
<P>
"OK, they got me there," he admits. "We also didn't use the seven-second 
delay." 
</P>
<P>
What really raises Bogosian's temperature, though, is the perception that "Talk 
Radio" is meant as a representation of all radio. 
</P>

"Look, part of the media -- TV and radio -- is dominated by self-centered 
big-mouths. The Morton Downeys, the Howard Sterns. Those were the guys who 
inspired Barry Champlain. But they're a fringe element. We're not talking about 
the strait-laced hosts like Michael Jackson or Toni Grant." 
</P>
<P>
Bogosian couldn't resist getting on the "Talk Radio" thumbs-up-or-down survey 
trend, and based on what he in half-jest called his "poll," a minority of radio 
people are critical of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"If you poll guys like Barry," he says, "they hate it. Besides, the movie's not 
just about radio. It's a portrait of the lost, soulless show business 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Bogosian is in a Beverly Hills hotel suite, and he's trying very hard to 
get comfortable. New York-based, he likes to get the material for his 
performance works ("FunHouse," "Drinking in America") by, among other things, 
dropping in on transvestite bars and Bowery coffee shops filled with hookers 
and pimps. His life, he'll tell you, has had its wild passages. 
</P>
<P>
That's the past. He's 35 and married and has a young child. Home is no longer 
Little Italy, but the New Jersey countryside. No more the hustle of performance 
art gigs in downtown lairs. Now he picks his movies and prepares pieces for HBO 
broadcast (such as his upcoming "Sex, Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll"). 
</P>
<P>
He roams the suite, pointing his guest to a sofa chair ("You want to sit 
here?"), unsure where he wants to sit, circling around the room ("Or how about 
here?"). With curly hair, tight jeans and pointed shoes, Bogosian looks like 
he's in alien territory, wondering how he got here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for my life to run on a few separate tracks," he says, "and one 
of them has to be dangerous." He was referring to his visits to deepest Gotham, 
an adventure where theater and anthropology meet. "Too many of these hotel 
suites, and I'll go soft and run out of things to write about." 
</P>
<P>
Such a crisis seems inconceivable at this point. Bogosian says he has felt such 
a "charge" from doing the "Talk Radio" publicity tour that he's finding himself 
writing every day -- "something I've never experienced before" -- and sure 
enough, there's an electric typewriter next to the room phone. 
</P>
<P>
He has reason to write. As well as "Sex, Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll," he's working 
on "Blue Smoke," a screenplay for Universal about New York's jazz underground 
in the '50s. He's also looking ahead to an ensemble play based on his youthful 
years in middle-class Woburn, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Bogosian, then, can't be counted among those amazed at Oliver Stone's work pace 
-- editing "Talk Radio" while preparing his next film, "Born on the Fourth of 
July," for instance. 
</P>
<P>
"He does push it harder than me, though," he adds. "And I found that the 
element Oliver and I share is answering the question, 'What do I want to do?' 
The work is the important thing." 
</P>
<P>
Stone and he also veer apart in a classically generational way. 
</P>
<P>
"While Oliver was entrenched in the '60s, I came up in the '70s. I'm suspicious 
of the Establishment and the anti-Establishment. I'm also not of a school with 
a message to send, but of a smaller school which has something on its mind to 
talk about for an hour or two." 
</P>
<P>
Bogosian follows up on this, perhaps thinking like the exposed performer on 
stage: "My view is to look at yourself, the individual. Oliver's is to look at 
society. And there's that conflict in the film." 
</P>
<P>
Stone agrees with this assessment. However, Stone, talking by phone from 
Dallas, where "Talk Radio" was filmed and where he is editing "Born on the 
Fourth of July," remarked: "I've never worked with anyone who was more intense 
than I am. Eric seems to know no limits." 
</P>
<P>
"Talk Radio's" Barry Champlain uses the airwaves as a kind of blunt weapon and 
a shield to ward off what really is on his mind. Like shockmeister Howard 
Stern, he uses callers as cannon fodder for listeners' entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
The late Alan Berg's biography, "Talked to Death," written by Steven Singular, 
was used by Bogosian and Stone as narrative ballast in "Talk Radio's" 
stage-to-screen transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Like Berg, Champlain antagonizes the white supremacist group The Order. In real 
life, two Order members were given 50-year sentences in December, 1987, for 
Berg's 1984 murder in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
That was after Bogosian and Savinar molded "Talk Radio" for the theater. Even 
after Pressman became involved and bought the rights to Singular's book for 
expanding the screenplay beyond the stage script, Bogosian says that it was 
voices such as Stern's and Bob Grant's that remained the key sources for 
Champlain's character. 
</P>
<P>
He'll also reveal that Champlain's real father was an outrageous punk-like 
persona, named Ricky Paul, whom Bogosian adopted during his days in the '70s 
playing tough New York clubs as well as the alternative art haven, The Kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a verbal assault on the audience, like the punk groups did, only with 
words and action rather than guitars." 
</P>
<P>
Bogosian credits, as well, certain artist-friends of his, such as painters 
Robert Longo and David Salle, for their various techniques of juxtaposing 
seemingly incongruous images. They taught him, he says, "all sorts of secrets 
for writing." 
</P>
<P>
Another source was movies -- particularly Elia Kazan and Budd Schulberg's 
masterfully caustic tale of TV's early days "A Face in the Crowd." The "Face" 
was Lonesome Rhodes, played by then-newcomer Andy Griffith, who turned from a 
humble country bumpkin into a monstrous video megastar. 
</P>
<P>
"What disturbed me more, though," Bogosian says, "was Kazan. He wrote, 
directed, liked to do it all. I sometimes see myself -- the dark side -- in 
him. He ruined his and other's lives more than once. I wonder about the 
ambitious artist, devouring everything." 
</P>
<P>
This awareness, he suggests, has come about through a combination of two 
factors that ultimately made "Talk Radio": his growing ability to discipline 
himself and get down to work, and looking at mass media. 
</P>
<P>
"Our society thinks by way of mass media," he observes, sounding a little like 
Oliver Stone. "It isolates us. Yet the good thing about talk radio is that it 
brings companionship. I know when I was out alone on the road, that voice 
coming over the air was a comfort. Then is mass media destroying relationships? 
I don't know. And I don't want to analyze it too much, because my creative 
needs come out of emotions, not theories." 
</P>
<P>
On disciplining himself, he digs deeper: "My wife, Jo Anne, used to say about 
me that she never knew anyone who did less in a day than I did. I'd get up at 
noon because I'd been up all night. And, of course, before writing, it was 
essential to hang out with my pals sipping coffee. By the time all this was 
done, there was no time to write. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit the saturation point when I married Jo Anne (in 1980). We married right 
after we met, and I went right out on a European tour. I had to get it 
together." 
</P>
<P>
The next saturation point was when he was performing "Drinking in America" at 
Lincoln Center eight times a week. "I thought I could slide like before. No 
way. I had to be on. It was like having to perform terrific sex every night at 
8. You have to develop an area of calm around that. Now I'm able to write at 
will -- almost." 
</P>
<P>
Bogosian admits to enjoying the small storm kicked up by "Talk Radio," and he 
isn't shy about acknowledging that he would like to wield some creative power 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Then he catches himself: "It's not that fame and attention can be temporal. 
They are temporal."

STEPPING ABOARD THE STARSHIP 'ENTERPRISE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN FARLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Watching Howie Seago drop his dark gray felt hat onto his strawberry blond 
curls, there was no question he was an actor. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't just put on his hat. He did it with style and purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Seago has had to be more purposeful than most of his acting colleagues. He is 
deaf, which limits job possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I have made the work myself by my own perseverance," he said in an interview 
at Los Angeles International Airport the other day, where he had a couple of 
hours to spare between planes. 
</P>
<P>
Most actors have dreamt up characters whom they would like to play on a popular 
TV show. In Seago's case, he took his idea for a deaf character on "Star Trek: 
The Next Generation" to the show's producers last summer, and the result is an 
episode in which he guest stars as a 24th-Century mediator, not unlike Henry 
Kissinger. The episode airs in Los Angeles at 8 p.m. Saturday and again at 5 
p.m. Sunday on KCOP Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Hurley, the effusive co-executive producer of "Star Trek," recalled 
that he and his colleagues knew as soon as they met with Seago that they would 
use him on the show in some way. "Because he has the presence of a movie star, 
and I'm saying movie star, I'm not saying just a good actor," he explained. "He 
dominates. You can't take your eyes off him." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't simply Seago's blue-eyed attractiveness. It's his way of 
communicating. 
</P>
<P>
Since he prefers to sign rather than speak, he has several interpreters he uses 
regularly. At the LAX interview, it was Rico Peterson who signed the reporter's 
questions to Seago and spoke Seago's signed responses. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't sound very dramatic, but the 35-year-old Seago used his eyes, 
face, hands and body so expressively that he very nearly gave off sparks. 
Peterson kept up with him, translating sign to word with such close 
synchronicity that the interpreter's presence faded from mind. 
</P>
<P>
Onstage or onscreen, of course, Seago is on his own. Once the cameras began 
rolling on "Star Trek," for example, he needed visual cues from the other 
actors. 
</P>
<P>
"Star Trek" star Patrick Stewart, who worked closely with Seago during filming, 
said, "It requires a technique for communicating which can be learned very 
briefly. By the end of the first day's work, I was unaware that there was 
anything different." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Stewart said, there was something special about the 
experience: "When you're dealing with an actor who has the authentic handicap, 
that person carries an authentic tension around with him and it never 
dissipates; it's always present. Whereas with an actor without the handicap, 
that is necessarily going to fluctuate. And I think all the actors in the show 
were sensitive, aware of, and sometimes even nervous of that very 
idiosyncratric tension. And tension is what makes theater." 
</P>
<P>
Talking Heads musician David Byrne was so impressed when he saw Seago star in a 
1986 adaptation of the Sophocles tragedy "Ajax," staged at Washington, D.C.'s 
Kennedy Center and then at the La Jolla Playhouse, that Byrne and his producing 
partner Robert Wilson recruited Seago for the lead role of the Forest King in a 
play they produced in Germany last fall, "The Forest." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, as Achilles in a National Theater of the Deaf production, "The Iliad, 
Play by Play," Seago moved Newsweek's Jack Kroll to write, "Not since Olivier's 
Oedipus has an actor come so close to the primal power of Greek tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
For the role of Caliban in a 1987 La Jolla Playhouse production of "The 
Tempest," Seago competed with hearing actors, and won. 
</P>
<P>
What's significant about the "Star Trek" role for Seago -- aside from the 
exposure, his biggest audience yet -- is that "I started the idea from 
scratch," he said, crediting his wife with the inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife (Lori Seago), who is a Trekkie, suggested to me that since 'Star Trek' 
is science fiction, the problem of providing a voice for a deaf character could 
be handled very creatively." 
</P>
<P>
Developing that thought, Seago "borrowed the idea of using a chorus from 
'Ajax,' " he explained. In the finished "Star Trek" episode, he communicates 
through a chorus of three -- a warrior, a scholar and a cultured woman. "If he 
wants to be aggressive, he'll use the warrior's voice; if he wants to be 
gentle, he'll use the woman. If only it were true in real life!" 
</P>
<P>
The show is the result of an unusual degree of collaboration between guest star 
and producers. 
</P>
<P>
"Star Trek's" Hurley recalled that Seago originally brought to them a "general 
idea for a deaf character. He wanted to be a regular on the show, maybe. We had 
a general exploratory conversation and in the course of that, he mentioned 
something that triggered off the whole idea of Henry Kissinger. Then we just 
started working on the story." (Jackie Zambrano is credited as the episode's 
writer.) 
</P>
<P>
Said Seago, "When I first started working, I thought that my character had to 
sign, so the chorus would understand him. But the producers had a more unique 
point of view. They wanted Riva to be arrogant, like Kissinger in real life, so 
his signing became unimportant to him. He and the chorus are so attuned, he 
would communicate with a simple gesture in place of many lines. So when he gets 
to the crisis point (and has lost his chorus), he has to use a more 
conventional mode of signing, which makes for a nice contrast." 
</P>
<P>
The first draft clashed with one of Seago's strongly held beliefs, however. "To 
resolve the dilemma when he's cut off from communication, they wanted me (his 
character) to speak overnight," the actor said. "I told them I couldn't do that 
because it would perpetuate the psychological harm that's done now in forcing 
deaf children to use their voice whether they can or not. I didn't want hearing 
parents to use the show to perpetuate the oppression of their children. 
</P>
<P>
"And they (the producers) understood that. I was expecting them to be more 
intractable. That was a real, honest-to-God relief for me and a credit to the 
producers, not only in accepting the idea but in executing and designing it 
properly." 
</P>
<P>
Seago can speak understandably, but the issue of speech is a complicated one 
for him. "I grew up in an oral program where sign language was not permitted," 
he said. "It was repressed." Meanwhile, at home, "I used homemade sign language 
with my brothers and my friends all my life. 
</P>
<P>
"It was only when I went to college and learned (standard) sign language that I 
started to develop as a person. I'm still angry that I was repressed all those 
years of my education by too much emphasis on learning to speak, rather than 
learning. And that's still going on (in some schools)." 
</P>
<P>
Before he made a decision to stick with signing in professional situations, he 
had some strange meetings with casting directors, he said: "They just didn't 
seem to understand that I was deaf. (He explained that, as a good lip reader, 
he may catch half or three-fourths of what is said.) So they would think of me 
as hard of hearing, or some kind of alien with a strange voice." 
</P>
<P>
A stint at working local theater in Hawaii proved important to the actor 
because "there was a woman who was a director with a youth theater there who 
had a good idea of how to use deaf actors in regular productions," he said. "I 
felt that I was finally free of the ball and chain of being 'a deaf actor.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the TV and movie industries, however, the ball and chain are still there. 
"Theater is more open to nontraditional casting than TV or movies," Seago 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Hurley acknowledged that if it hadn't been for the Writers Guild strike 
last summer, Seago and his idea might never have been looked at by the "Star 
Trek" producers. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sitting around during the strike," he recalled, "and someone said 'Do 
you want to meet an actor with good credentials, who happens to be deaf?' And 
we did it for that reason -- that there was really not a whole lot else to do. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone had called me last spring (before the strike), and said, 'There's a 
deaf actor who wants to meet you,' I'd say, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll call 
you,' but with the time constraints of episodic television, you just don't have 
time to do those kinds of things. Since this happened, it's made me more 
willing to listen to the phone. If some strange phone call came now, I'd think, 
'I better take it. I'd better not miss a chance to meet another Howie Seago.' "

HOUSING PANEL CENSURES TENANT FOR ANTI-DRUG SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Housing Commission slapped a San Ysidro tenant activist with a 
lease-violation notice when she posted public signs in a campaign against 
neighborhood drug dealers, stirring neighbors' fears of retaliation, according 
to testimony to the Housing Commission Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Byrd-Reis said she posted the signs in her car windows after she found 
her tires slashed Labor Day, in the midst of her yearlong battle against drug 
dealers, drug users, alien smugglers and transients who she said used the 
parking lot of her Alaquinas Drive apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd-Reis, who said she and her family had been threatened by dealers because 
of her campaign to drive them from the Vista del Valle project, plastered her 
windshield with banners reading "TIRE WORK: COURTESY OF DRUG DEALER &amp; 
'GANGS', INC." and "DRUG DEALER, WHAT'S NEXT, WHO'S NEXT?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fear of Retaliation 
</P>
<P>
Three other tenants, fearful that they could be hurt by retaliating dealers, 
complained to the Housing Commission, which operates the complex, said Dana 
Sievert, housing program director. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd-Reis was given 24 hours to remove the signs or be given a lease-violation 
notice for endangering the safety of other tenants. On Nov. 4, the sanction was 
made official, eliminating Byrd-Reis' status as a tenant in good standing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the penalty has little practical effect -- Byrd-Reis would have to 
commit three more infractions before facing eviction -- it does prevent 
Byrd-Reis from becoming the apartment block's official representative if it 
forms a tenant council, Sievert said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard," said San Diego Councilman Bob 
Filner, who represents San Ysidro and has worked with Byrd-Reis and Residents 
Organizing to Assist Residents, or ROAR, the tenant group she leads. "If I get 
a parking ticket, I'm not disqualified from being a city councilman. We should 
be working with her, instead of ignoring her." 
</P>
<P>
Filner, who is a housing commissioner, promised to investigate Byrd-Reis' claim 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to express ourselves, the San Diego Housing Commission should allow 
us to do it, whatever form it takes, as long as it's non-libelous, non-profane, 
and doesn't incite a riot," Byrd-Reis said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sievert, who agreed that the project was the site of drug activity, said 
that Housing Commission administrators took action in consideration of other 
tenants' safety. 
</P>
<P>
"As property managers, we need to be concerned with the overall safety of the 
place, and we'd had some calls about that," she said. "The residents were 
concerned that whoever did the first action would come back and retaliate for 
the sign." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Beyond Activism' 
</P>
<P>
"It goes beyond activism that is totally constructive," said Evan Becker, the 
Housing Commission's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
The commission fulfilled Byrd-Reis and fellow tenants' most urgent request 
Thursday, when it approved a contract to hire security guards for Vista del 
Valle and two other apartment complexes it manages. 
</P>
<P>
Three security guards will patrol Byrd-Reis' parking lot from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. 
on a trial basis beginning Feb. 1, Sievert said. The move is a significant 
policy shift for the Housing Commission, which had been wary of the expense, 
potential liability and precedent of getting into the security business, Becker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protection Needed 
</P>
<P>
But Byrd-Reis and some other tenants believe that security guards are the only 
way to permanently rid the complex of dealers. Although police have been 
responsive to calls, even Byrd-Reis has refused to testify in court because of 
fear of retaliation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Housing Commission has secured doors and windows, improved outside lighting 
and added landscaping in an effort to deter drug activity, but failed, she 
said. Byrd-Reis said she has taken photos of drug dealers and confronted 
transients to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
"That type of activity is like cockroaches," she said. "You bring the light and 
they disappear." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd-Reis said she plans to appeal the lease-violation notice.

CHAPMAN, MCFERRIN LEAD GRAMMY RACE; 
</P>
<P>
BAKER, STING, MICHAEL, WINWOOD ALSO CAPTURE MUTLIPLE NOMINATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tracy Chapman won the nominations derby Thursday in the first leg of the record 
industry's 31st annual Grammy Awards competition. 
</P>
<P>
The folk-minded singer-songwriter's six nominations nosed out jazz singer Bobby 
McFerrin, who had five, and pop-jazz artist Anita Baker, who picked up four. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's self-titled debut album, which has sold more than 2 million copies, 
features the hit single "Fast Car." Her nominations are for best record, album, 
song, pop vocal, contemporary folk record and new artist. 
</P>
<P>
If the 24-year-old Boston-based artist wins in all categories, it will be the 
biggest sweep in the history of the recording industry awards. Winners will be 
announced Feb. 22 during a nationally televised ceremony at the Shrine 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
McFerrin, who has won five jazz Grammys, was introduced to pop audiences 
through his hit single "Don't Worry, Be Happy." Besides being nominated for 
that record, he was also cited for best album ("Simple Pleasures"), pop vocal 
and song ("Don't Worry, Be Happy"). He was also nominated in the jazz vocal 
category for a work contained in Rob Wasserman's "Duets" album. 
</P>
<P>
Three-time winner Anita Baker, cited for her hit single "Giving You the Best 
That I Got," is competing in four categories -- best record and song as well as 
R &amp; B song and R &amp; B vocal. 
</P>
<P>
For best record, Baker's single, Chapman's "Fast Car" and McFerrin's "Don't 
Worry, Be Happy" are up against Michael Jackson's "Man in the Mirror" and Steve 
Winwood's "Roll With it." 
</P>
<P>
Winwood's single is from his "Roll With it" album, which is also up for album 
of the year. His competitors are Chapman, McFerrin, Sting (". . . Nothing Like 
the Sun") and George Michael ("Faith"). 
</P>
<P>
Winwood, who became the first artist to be nominated for best record three 
years in a row, was also nominated this year for best pop vocal. Sting, a 
four-time winner, is also up for three awards, including pop vocal and song 
("Be Still My Beating Heart"). 
</P>
<P>
For best song, a songwriters' award, Sting's challengers are Chapman, McFerrin, 
Baker and the team of Brenda Russell, Jeff Hall and Scott Cutler, who were 
nominated for "Piano in the Dark." 
</P>
<P>
This year's big surprise was the failure of British pop sensation George 
Michael to nab more than two nominations. Michael had figured to be among the 
leaders in nominations because his "Faith" album received generally favorable 
reviews and sold more than 6 million copies. Besides the "Faith" album 
nomination, Michael's only other nod was for pop vocal. 
</P>
<P>
In the best new artist category, Chapman is up against Rick Astley, Toni 
Childs, the group Take 6 and Vanessa Williams, the dethroned Miss America. 
Williams made the national pop charts last year with a single, "The Right 
Stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The winners in the 76 pop and classical categories will be determined by a vote 
of the more than 7,000 members of the National Assn. of Recording Arts and 
Sciences. Records released in the United States between Oct. 1, 1987, and Sept. 
30, 1988, were eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Two new categories were added this year: rap and hard-rock/metal. The rap 
nominees included L.L. Cool J, D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince, 
Salt-N-Pepa, J.J. Fad and Kool Moe Dee. In hard-rock/metal, the competitors are 
Metallica, AC-DC, Iggy Pop, Jethro Tull and Jane's Addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, male and female rock vocal nominees were lumped together because 
there were too few eligible female entries. Since this was banner year for 
female rockers, they have their own category again. The rock female finalists 
are Pat Benatar, Melissa Etheridge, Toni Childs, Sinead O'Connor and Tina 
Turner. The male rock nominees are Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, Robbie Robertson, 
Robert Palmer and Joe Cocker. 
</P>
<P>
Vying with Anita Baker for the female R&amp;B vocal award are Pebbles, Taylor 
Dayne, Karyn White and Vanessa Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The male R &amp; B contenders are Luther Vandross, Stevie Wonder, Terence Trent 
D'Arby, Teddy Pendergrass and Al B. Sure!. 
</P>
<P>
In country, the finalists in the best vocal category are Emmylou Harris, K.T. 
Oslin, K.D. Lang, Reba McEntire and Tanya Tucker. For the male award, the 
challengers are Dan Seals, Dwight Yoakam, Rodney Crowell, Randy Travis and Lyle 
Lovett. 
</P>
<P>
There were few surprises in the classical field. Perennial nominees Vladimir 
Horowitz, Robert Shaw, Georg Solti and Leonard Bernstein -- perhaps a 
sentimental favorite in his 70th year -- filled the best album choices. 
</P>
<P>
Trendy long shots from both early and new music appeared on some of the lists. 
Period specialists Roger Norrington and the London Classical Players received a 
best orchestral recording bid for their Beethoven's Ninth, and "Nixon in China" 
was an inevitable nominee for best opera recording. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the best opera list was "A Quiet Place," by Leonard Bernstein and 
Stephen Wadsworth. Those two new operas headed the best contemporary 
composition category, which was completed with William Bolcom's Symphony No. 4, 
Ned Rorem's String Symphony (a best-album pick in the Shaw performance), and 
"Amour" by Karlheinz Stockhausen.

'PUMPKINHEAD': SO MANY WRITERS, SO LITTLE EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The extensive writing credits for the horror film "Pumpkinhead" (citywide) read 
like a confusing textbook case of Hollywood ampersands and arbitrated 
punctuation: Screenplay by Mark Patrick Carducci with Gary Gerani, based on a 
story by Carducci and Stan Winston &amp; Richard C. Weinman, inspired by a poem 
(!!!) by Ed Justin. 
</P>
<P>
With no fewer than five writers involved, it's almost a cinch that the 
carefully crafted result of so many skilled hands at work will be juicy 
dialogue -- such as "Don't go out there!" "Molly's out there!" and "God is the 
only thing that can stop what's out there!" 
</P>
<P>
What's out there is not the Great Pumpkin, alas, but a 12-foot-tall demon that 
hisses and snickers before dispatching its teen-age victims. The creature in 
question gets its moniker from the "pumpkin patch/graveyard" in which its 
remains lie buried -- that is, when it isn't being called forth and resurrected 
by the local Southern bumpkins, who occasionally dispatch Pumpkinhead on 
missions of vengeance with the help of a witch. 
</P>
<P>
This loathsome evil spirit's head does not resemble any indigenous backwoods 
fruit, but its insect-cum-anthropoid form is suspiciously similar to that of 
the title villain of "Alien," albeit less slimy and more wrinkled. (Picture 
Sigourney Weaver being terrorized by a monster wearing Dustin Hoffman's old-age 
makeup from "Little Big Man" and you'll have the idea.) 
</P>
<P>
The unpleasantness is set in motion when a pack of city kids visit the country 
to do some dirt-biking, and the most obnoxious of the boys, drunk, accidentally 
strikes and kills the young son of a local fruit-stand owner. (If nothing else, 
the film is an effective "Don't Drink and Motocross" public-service 
commercial.) The teen-agers flee the accident scene but soon their remote cabin 
is besieged by a rifle-resistant Pumpkinhead, turned loose by the distraught 
dad. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually the picture turns into a morality tale about how revenge, once 
tasted, is not so sweet, as the father (played by Lance Henriksen, the helpful 
android of "Aliens") comes to regret the carnage he's set in motion. Even he 
can't undo the spell, though, and soon realizes that to do battle with the 
demon, he must literally do battle with himself. It's an interesting idea -- 
though not nearly as interesting as it was 33 years ago in "Forbidden Planet," 
which had Walter Pidgeon engaged in much more compelling combat with his own 
id. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Winston steps in as director (and co-scenarist) here after many years 
leading one of Hollywood's top special makeup effects units. Ironically, 
Winston shows a surer directorial touch with the early, more human scenes 
(especially those between Henriksen and son) than he does later with the spooks 
and scares, which are never even faintly frightening. He doesn't win any more 
points for having his creature followed by artsy mood lighting wherever it goes 
in the supposedly black night. 
</P>
<P>
The one major departure "Pumpkinhead" (MPAA-rated R) offers from the 
supernatural-mass-murder-in-the-woods genre, for which some gratitude may be in 
order, is that its young actors don't engage in the usual illicit sex 
immediately before being punished with a gruesome slaughter. But neither do 
they read, uh, poetry -- not even the alluded-to "Pumpkinhead, The Poem." All 
those writers and not even one pro-literacy plug?

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A second day of racial violence Tuesday left at least eight people shot, one 
fatally, and dozens of stores burned and looted. 
</P>
<P>
Plumes of smoke soared above the predominantly black neighborhoods of Overtown 
and Liberty City, darkening the eye of a municipal face that so badly wanted to 
look good for Super Bowl week. 
</P>
<P>
Instead there showed the ugly lines of racial tension. More than 230 people 
were arrested as police moved in convoys of officers -- called field forces -- 
trying to keep a serious disturbance from erupting further. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities told law-abiding citizens to remain indoors as they began the 
block-by-block sweep. 
</P>
<P>
The violent outbreak was sparked by the fatal shooting Monday night of an 
unarmed black motorcyclist by a Latino policeman. A second man on the 
motorcycle died Tuesday from injuries suffered when the motorcycle hit a car. 
</P>
<P>
All day Tuesday, community leaders walked the boulevards, urging residents to 
be calm. 
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of our city, I appeal to every citizen regardless of race to stay 
calm, get off the streets and stay in your homes," Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez 
said in a televised appeal Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Police blockaded entire neighborhoods from outsiders, but the cork would not 
stay on the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
The first shooting took place in the early afternoon when a crowd heaved rocks 
at the white driver of a luxury car in Overtown. As he sped away, the man 
pulled a gun and fired into the crush. Derrick Mitchell, 19, was hit. He 
remained hospitalized in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
After dark, seven others were shot, authorities said, though details remained 
sketchy and sometimes changing. An alleged looter was shot in Liberty City by 
police, as was an alleged sniper. A 7-year-old girl was wounded in the leg by 
stray gunfire, police said. Liberty City is several miles northwest of 
Overtown. 
</P>
<P>
A Miami policeman, Eric Butler, was struck with birdshot, but his bullet-proof 
vest blunted the impact and he was not seriously injured. His alleged assailant 
was later arrested atop a three-story building. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 p.m., a young black man was fatally shot in the head amid the Liberty 
City violence. Police quickly made an arrest, but were unsure how, or even if, 
the crime fit in to the racial melee. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day authorities tried different tactics. Often, they left angry 
crowds alone as long as damage was small. 
</P>
<P>
Other times, outnumbered officers watched helplessly as looters walked off with 
items as large as sofas and coffee tables. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally tear gas was used to disperse people. Sometimes the crowd struck 
back, hurling anything they could find. 
</P>
<P>
"I pay taxes for police protection!" one angry man shouted at police. "And all 
I end up doing is paying killers who kill people!" 
</P>
<P>
A TV news van also was attacked. Its crew cowered as the glass around them 
shattered. Several motorists had their windshields knocked in by rocks as they 
slowed on expressway exit ramps. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours after nightfall, Police Chief Perry Anderson announced that enough 
was enough. "We've been very tolerant. We've allowed the emotional to take 
place . . . and now it's time to bring the city back to order." 
</P>
<P>
The field forces plunged in. Arrests multiplied. People scattered. 
</P>
<P>
But still -- as midnight passed -- order was incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Local merchants dug in for all-night vigils, guarding businesses on streets 
where it is impossible to get insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Police saved grocer Ahmed Dabas, trapped by gunfire for two hours in his store. 
"The people were shouting, 'We're going to get you, white man,' " Dabas said. 
"They would have . . . killed us if it weren't for (police)." 
</P>
<P>
The trouble began Monday evening in Overtown after a Latino policeman, William 
Lozano, shot at two men on a motorcycle, killing the driver. Killed was Clement 
Lloyd, 23, part owner of a car wash and a black well-known in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, angry crowds began accusing the police of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about why the shooting occurred -- and how police handled the 
following disturbance -- have since vexed the city and fueled the rage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Open Season Against Blacks' 
</P>
<P>
Prominent ministers are among the incensed. "The people believe it's open 
season against blacks," said the Rev. Carleton Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the Justice Department announced it had opened a civil rights 
investigation into the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"The FBI is on the scene, and with them there, we are confident there will be a 
thorough and complete investigation," said department spokesman Mark Weaver in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Suarez made similar promises. Late Tuesday, he said he would ask the City 
Commission to name an independent review panel of private citizens to look into 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Suarez met Tuesday with black leaders and residents of Overtown, a neighborhood 
of run-down apartment buildings and trash-strewn vacant lots north of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the shooting, Lozano, 29, was on foot, taking a report from a 
crime victim, when he heard a radio report that another officer was pursuing a 
motorcycle for a speeding violation. 
</P>
<P>
"He heard the radio transmission and saw the motorcycle coming in his 
direction," police spokesman Angelo Bitsis said. "As the motorcycle either 
approached him or went by him, he fired his shot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4-Year Police Veteran 
</P>
<P>
Police have made no statement about whether the department believes the force 
used was justified. Lozano is a 4-year veteran of the force with several 
commendations. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet struck Lloyd in the back of the head, then his motorcycle slammed 
into an oncoming Buick. It was the gunshot that killed him, an autopsy showed. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd's passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24, died Tuesday from massive head injuries 
sustained in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
As both men were removed in ambulances Monday, Suarez walked through Overtown, 
trying to speak with Lloyd's mother and calm things down. 
</P>
<P>
He was chased off amid the first barrage of rocks and bottles. Police in riot 
gear then moved into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
That action -- the appearance of so many policemen in full battle garb -- 
infuriated the already angry crowd, many black civic leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
"The riot gear alone is enough to incite the people," said Annie Adker, a 
longtime Overtown activist.

For Miami boosters, the unrest came at the worst possible time, just prior to 
Sunday's championship Super Bowl XXIII game between the San Francisco 49ers and 
the Cincinnati Bengals -- even though Joe Robbie Stadium is miles from any of 
the street violence. 
</P>
<P>
The evening news on Miami television stations dealt as much with how the 
disturbances were hurting Miami's image, as how much they simply hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The racial violence breaks years of respite from such unrest. Miami had a 
serious riot in 1980, when 18 were killed. There were also disturbances in 1982 
and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The relative harmony belied the grim fact that not much has changed for black 
Miami, where average income is about half that of whites and the jobless rate 
exceeds the overall average by 50%.

Resentment Against Latinos 
</P>
<P>
Johnnie R. McMillian, president of the local chapter of the NAACP, said Tuesday 
that blacks are upset with the changing demographics of the community, where 
they feel they continually lose out in the job market to Latino immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"The African-Americans have felt cheated," she said. "We felt we were losing 
our place in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Blacks are also upset with the treatment of Haitian refugees -- who are often 
stopped at sea or, if they succeed in getting ashore, placed in detention 
camps. Other alien groups have fared better. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Nicaraguans -- most of them penniless -- recently have arrived in 
Miami. The city has turned its baseball stadium into a temporary shelter for 
them, and there has been an outpouring of private donations. 
</P>
<P>
"They interdict the Haitians at sea . . . and they meanwhile offer the 
red-carpet treatment to Nicaraguans," said the Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, an 
activist priest in the Haitian community. 
</P>
<P>
The Overtown neighborhood itself has declined in recent years. It was once a 
proud, vibrant community, the center of night life for black Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Then in the 1940s, thousands of people were removed for a proposed urban 
renewal program. But the main construction was not houses, but an expressway 
that cut the neighborhood in two. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, plans to erect new buildings usually have nothing to do with 
residents and much to do with powerful business interests. 
</P>
<P>
At the edge of Overtown is a brand new structure that city boosters view with 
boundless pride -- a basketball arena, home to the NBA's Miami Heat. 
</P>
<P>
An hour before Tuesday's scheduled tip-off against the Phoenix Suns, the city 
canceled the game. The danger was too great.
